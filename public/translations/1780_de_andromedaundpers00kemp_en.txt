A Play with Music.

To be found at the Logenmeister’s.
1788.

Characters:

Cepheus, King of Aethiopia.
Cassiopeia, his wife.
Andromeda, their daughter.

Perseus, son of Jupiter and Danaë.
Priests.
Young Men.
Maidens.
Guard.

(The stage represents a view of the open sea; on one side rocks, on the other [?]
in front a sacrificial altar.)

First Act.

[Andromeda], dressed in white, is led out by her parents, accompanied by a retinue of priests, young men, maidens, and guards. Incense is burned on the sacrificial altar. According to custom, no words should be spoken during such solemn ceremonies. But the Queen, overcome by intense sorrow, finally breaks out into these words:

Cassiopeia.
Alas! — alas! . . . Andromeda, my [?]
murderer!

High Priest.
Queen! (He places his finger on his mouth.)

Cassiopeia.
Unhappy sacrifice! . . . Can you forgive me?

High Priest.
Queen! the sacrifice is profaned.

Cassiopeia.
Ha! too cruel . . .

(The priests lead Andromeda to the rock, from which the prepared chains are already hanging, and fasten her to it. She permits everything to happen patiently. Father and mother express the liveliest grief, rush towards her in despair, and cling to her until the priests finally pull them away, and, along with the entire retinue, are compelled to leave the stage.)

Second Act.

Andromeda (alone.)

. . . So here — abandoned by men — rejected by gods — thrown to the monsters as prey, I must await my doom . . . Wretched creature! — did you only spring from royal blood to be snatched away in your bloom . . . to be so pitifully snatched away? Is this the altar, you gods! that you appointed for my wedding . . . my wedding with death . . . Are these the festive wedding wreaths, (pointing to the chains) that are to adorn me on my wedding day? (?) And this, gods! — can this be a charming spectacle for you? . . . An insignificant weakness of a woman — a heinous crime in your eyes — can only be atoned for by the death of your only child? . . . Only the blood of an innocent maiden can satisfy your wrath! You cruel ones! if this sight increases your delight, then look down from Olympus upon this worm . . . Crush it! Crush it! and triumph in your great victory. Worm! . . . Yes! wretched worm! you dare to penetrate the fabric of fate? . . . you — your counsels . . . (she falls to her knees) Forgive, Almighty ones, a creature whose senses are confused by the fear of annihilation. . . . Yes! the oracle’s decree shall be fulfilled in me . . . Here I am. Without complaint — without resistance, I offer my neck to the judgment. But you gave me the nature of a mortal — O grant me also the courage — grant me the strength of an immortal, to accomplish what you have decided for me. . . . (she stands up) It is glory — . . . It is bliss for me to be a sacrifice of atonement between gods and men. . . . To give my life for whom I received it. To avert the disaster from my fatherland that has already ravaged it for so long. . . . Open yourselves, you immeasurable abysses. . . . Spew forth your monsters, that they may devour the sacrifice that blazes here for reconciliation. . . . Here it is . . . Here it is . . . (the music gradually becomes very soft and finally fades completely. A long pause.) What a ghastly silence — dreadful, unbearable anticipation. . . . (the music begins again very softly) The chill of death trembles through every nerve. Cold sweat of fear trickles down my forehead. What dreadful images of monsters float before my eyes. It is slow—

[Andromeda continues.]

mer — a thousandfold death . . . . (The beast emerges from the cave under a thick mist, and crawls, without seeing Andromeda, directly towards the sea, into which it plunges from the shore. The music is ghastly to the point of nausea. It begins softly, as if from a distance, grows stronger, until finally the beast appears, where it breaks off violently, and a pause is made. During this pause, Andromeda exclaims:) Mercy — mercy, almighty gods!. . . What hellish form! What a death! . . . . (during the music) My life! No! — I do not demand that — An axe — a dagger — a cup of poison would be solace to me. . . . O Jupiter! a thunderbolt hurled from your hand into this breast — . . . . (the music expresses the thunder) O Neptune! an earthquake, stirred by you, that this rock may collapse upon me . . . (the music imitates the trembling of the earthquake) Ha! there the rock rears itself high up. . . . Terror!

[Andromeda continues.]

Terror! . . . It emerges! (the beast appears but sinks again. Andromeda believes it is coming for her) Mercy — help — help — . . . . (she faints and hangs limply on the chains.)

Third Act.

Andromeda, and Perseus.

(Perseus emerges on the height of the rock, from the same side where Andromeda is bound to the rock, so that the rock conceals her, and he does not see her immediately. He sits down to rest and observe the surroundings. The music is calm, pleasant, and playful.)

Perseus.
How endlessly the plain stretches out there! . . . How gently the hills there rise from the dark myrtle forest with their pale vine-green! . . . How the waterfall sprays clouds of mist upwards! . . . How the colorful herds of all kinds paint the pastures traversed by winding streams. . . . And this mighty rock face here — how it dams back the restless element — and only opens here and there into a pleasant harbor. . . . If this charming region is matched by its inhabitants, then this is Elysium. But what do I see there? A statue! . . . Strange! . . . A stone statue! — at the maw of a gloomy cave! . . . A maiden in chains.

Andromeda. (takes a deep breath.)

Perseus.
What? It breathes? . . . It moves. . . . A living creature. . . . Ha! a maiden of rare charms. . . . Tears on her cheeks? . . . How enchanting the sight! One must investigate this more closely. . . . (he descends from the rock and observes Andromeda from the side of the rock; the music is plaintive.)

Andromeda.
No — alas!. . . Am I still here? . . . Why must I awaken to a new life? . . . Already the monster held me in its jaws — already it plunged with me into the abysses of the sea. . . . Alas! — that it was only a phantom, that I had to revive to experience this torment once more — a thousand times more. . . . Why do you linger, hideous miscreation. . . . Gods! if you are implacable — if there is no more mercy with you — why do you hesitate? — death — death.

[Andromeda continues.]

[Perseus.]
Dare a stranger — —

Andromeda.
(is greatly startled and recoils) Gods! Gods! . . .

Perseus.
Do not be frightened, beautiful child! Are my weapons terrible to you? — I cast them aside. (he lays down his shield, helmet, sword, and wings.) . . . Look at me now — What is still terrible about me?

Andromeda.
(looks at him, but turns away again) Monster! Even in this form, I do not fail to recognize you — Even under this disguise, I recognize my murderer — here is your prey.

[Perseus.]
(to himself) The riddle unfolds. Her senses are confused. . . . But why chained here?. . . The most lovable creature I have seen on this earth.

Andromeda.
(with her face still turned away) Do you still hesitate! — alas, death — death.

Perseus.
If your senses are not completely numbed, then tell me, unfortunate one, what is the cause of your misery? Perhaps I can help.

Andromeda.
Alas, no help for me — (confused) Death holds me captive in its iron arms. . . . Do you see how tightly it encircles my arms . . . (she throws herself forward into the chains) Do you see the maw there? . . . It opens wide. Flee — you will be devoured with me. . . . Fot! no help — no help.

Perseus.
Good! no help — But tell me, who are you? What do you speak of monsters? of murderers, of death?

Andromeda.
(looks at him shyly again) (to herself) Could it be — . . . gods! this form . . . these eyes — . . . What blinds my . . . . Impossible — Impossible — Fr—

Perseus.
Recover yourself — Wake from this deathly slumber — perhaps the gods send me to your liberation.

Andromeda.
Liberation? . . . Do you claim to be a god, who may speak thus? . . . No mortal can save me. . . . No! delusion — blinding — away — away. . . .

Perseus.
Poor child! Your fate touches my soul. When the last ray of hope vanishes — when despair repels all comfort — then one is too deeply sunk. . . . Where is the inhuman — the tyrant — who does not recognize these features of innocence — who mistreats these blooming charms . . . Here is my arm. An arm accustomed to deeds. . . . It shall free you — punish the transgressors. . . . Where are they? . . . You are silent? . . . Should any crime —

[Perseus continues.]

Andromeda.
Crime? — Ha! now I can — now I may no longer remain silent. . . . Yes! the state in which you see me indicates a criminal — But the Almighty know — I am innocent. . . . Know then, stranger, whoever you may be, that I am not here atoning for my guilt — no! a small transgression of a mother. . . . that I die for the salvation of my people. . . . Cepheus, the ruler of these Aethiopian lands, is my begetter — Cassiopeia my mother. . . . the best, the most tender of all mothers — the ornament of her sex. . . . seduced by a small vanity — forgive it a woman — by a small vanity, she boasted of surpassing the Nereids in charm. . . . Enflamed by revenge, these proud nymphs urged Neptune to punish the transgression. . . . He banished the most monstrous of his spawn to this shore — here into these caves. . . . For years his unstoppable rage has raged among the inhabitants. . . . Only to be sated by my blood — alas! —

[Perseus.]
I guess the consequence — an oracle’s decree?

Andromeda.
From Jupiter Ammon.

Perseus.
Enough! . . . Here in this cave, you say—

(He quickly gathers his weapons and rushes towards the cave.)

Andromeda.
Wait! what do you want?

[Perseus.]
To shame the unjust oracle.

Andromeda.
Dare not! The wrath of the gods has even more severe punishments — Let me appease him with my blood . . . in vain would you risk your life. . . . Let the oracle’s decree be fulfilled by the unhappy Andromeda.

Perseus.
(steps up to her) I would risk a thousand lives to preserve yours. . . . Your charms, Princess, inspire my courage. . . . O, dare I hope — . . . dare I hope — after this deed, from your heart — — No! no conditions — the deed first — then you determine the reward. . . .

(He rushes towards the cave again.)

Andromeda.

Wait! noble stranger! In vain would you wander through the gloomy cave — in vain search for my enemy. . . . First the monster, still unaware of its prey, plunged from the shore into the sea. . . . In the distance, it rolls in the [?]

Perseus.
Good! Then I will await it here. SR No other way shall it find to you than through this breast.

Andromeda.
(to herself) Gods! what a sentiment possesses my whole heart . . . What could armies do? how could one [?]! Flee — escape . . . . to see you, most noble one, perish before my eyes would double my torment. . . . And even if you succeed in the deed — oh, Neptune has thousands more of these monsters! >

Perseus.
Perseus, begotten from Jupiter’s blood, finds other ways to appease the wrath of the gods.

Andromeda.
What do you say? . . . From Jupiter’s blood? . . . . A god! — a god will be my protector? —

Perseus.
Not just a protector — . . . (he falls at her feet) your adorer — he is your adorer. . . . Carried by Mercury’s wings, I traverse the sphere of this earth from pole to pole, and only here — only here does my heart find the goal

[Perseus continues.]

[Perseus continues.]

of its wanderings. . . . Only you, fairest of earth’s daughters, decide my fate. . . . O speak — may Perseus hope for his happiness from you?

Perseus.
O speak it out — speak out the word that hangs on your lips. If I save your life. . . . so 101 your [?]

Andromeda.
(tenderly) Alas! — what ER. . . .

[Andromeda continues.]

This life is not my own, . . . my heart — my hand is in my power.

Perseus.
And even if she were — how you are immune. . . .

Andromeda.
I have parents!

Perseus.
And if they promised me your hand — what did your heart say to that?

Andromeda.
(somewhat confused) My heart? . . . . O my poor heart willingly accepted death from them — how will it accept life — and with life, the life that I would have to thank the most heroic man for. . . . and who saved me from death — from death — O my father — the best of fathers — My mother — the most tender of mothers. . . . Forgive — my confusion. . . . My heart is good — good — grateful.

Perseus.
I ask for no more. (he jumps up and grasps the chains.)

Andromeda.
What are you doing?

Perseus.
The first step to your liberation. (he tries to loosen the chains.)

Andromeda.
Stop, Perseus! — these bonds are sacred to me —

Perseus.
(lets go) So you resist your own liberation?

[Andromeda.]
Who can — who dares to resist the will of the gods . . . They placed these chains on me through my parents. . . . Never again can I allow them to be removed by anyone other than my parents.

Perseus.
O if only they were here! on my knees I would implore them — to leave you alone — in this danger — (he looks intently at the surface of the sea) it is indeed all calm — up to the horizon no suspicious creature. . . . But. . . . Ha! thank you, you gods! I follow the inspiration. . . . (he breaks off a branch with his sword, sticks it into a crevice of the rock not far from Andromeda, and hangs his shield, with the Medusa head facing outwards towards the sea.)

[Perseus continues.]

The brood of hell wanders hidden among the waves — if they dare — then their slightest punishment shall be petrification. . . . That palace there must be the dwelling of your father. . . . I shall be back here soon. . . . Courage! Andromeda — Courage! One more moment, and you will be free. . . . (he picks up the wings from the ground and says as he leaves) Ha! Mercury! your wings have never been so valuable to me. . . . (he departs with the greatest haste.)

Fourth Act.

Andromeda (alone.)

What an impenetrable riddle. . . . Here the horror of death. . . . there the bliss of the most fortunate life. . . . Shall all this still be illusion? . . . Has the sun only smiled upon me before my demise, so that the darkness of the abyss seems even gloomier? . . . Innocent, I grew up at the breast of beloved parents — how easily I could have sacrificed for them a life that I believed I only had for them. But now — but now — what a powerful pull towards life — what a raging abhorrence of death! . . . The beast shows itself at some distance on the surface of the sea, but soon sinks again. Andromeda does not see it, because Perseus’s shield obstructs her view of the sea.

The music begins to become more ghastly.) Gods! what a new — never felt flame do you kindle in my breast? . . . What human form — what divine image do you present to my eyes — eyes that have only seen monsters floating? Just gods! must you be so cruel — so insatiable in vengeance? — to give more only to take more? . . . No! no — my gods are not—

[Andromeda continues.]

The ray of hope, which refreshes my soul, shines down upon me from above. (The monster appears closer and hides again, still unseen by Andromeda.) It has disappeared. . . . (with apprehension) Will it return?

Will it free me? . . . . How this heart pounds — it did not beat so before death . . . (the music is weak) What ghastly tones whirl through the air. . . . the death cry approaches — the whole storm of destruction breaks loose. . . . O Perseus! perhaps too

[Andromeda continues.]

late . . . too late! (The music becomes extremely ghastly. The beast appears very close to the shore and is about to crawl up it, when suddenly Perseus leaps out, tears down his shield, and throws himself at the beast with drawn sword.)

Fifth Act.

Andromeda, Perseus.

Andromeda.
(startled by Perseus’s haste) Gods! Merciful gods! . . . .

Perseus.
(to the beast) Back, cursed hell-hound, er—

Andromeda.
Perseus! Perseus! we are lost! (The beast spits mist and water at Perseus. As he cannot harm it from the front, he climbs onto a projecting piece of rock and attacks the beast’s back. The sea is stained with blood. The wounded beast gradually becomes weaker, but does not cease to struggle against Perseus. Perseus holds on with his left hand

[Perseus continues.]

and with his right hand he still fights the beast, until finally it succumbs to so many blows and drifts lifelessly on the sea, belly up.)

Andromeda.
(During this fight, under a terrible music, she expresses alternating fear, hope, joy, and despair through gestures. During this time, the King, the Queen, and many people appear on the distant shore.)

Perseus.
Thanks be to the gods! — Andromeda is

[Perseus continues.]

Hail to the victor! Hail to the rescuer!

Sixth Act.

All.

The King and the Queen, accompanied by many attendants, hasten into Andromeda’s arms. Two sacrificial altars are brought and placed on each side of the stage, so that the previous one is in the middle.)

Cepheus.
My daughter! O.

Cassiopeia.
My Andromeda! Beloved child! Are you mine again?

Andromeda.
(with a hoarse voice) Best father! — Dearest mother. . . . Alas! relief. . . . Where is my eee

Cepheus and Cassiopeia.
He is your husband!

(The priests release Andromeda from the rock.)

Perseus.
(meanwhile descends from the rock, places his shield, with the Medusa head turned downwards, on strewn reeds, and washes the blood from his hands.)

Cepheus.
(takes him by the hand and leads him to Andromeda) Come, victor! — Come, rescuer! — receive your self-chosen reward! . . .

Perseus.
Andromeda’s arms are now free from chains — May her heart be just as free from constraint — Your paternal . . . your new

[Perseus continues.]

Andromeda.
Perseus! not out of obedience — not out of gratitude — (she offers him her hand) out of choice — :

Perseus.
So, divine Andromeda, my happiness is complete. Let us above all—

[Perseus continues.]

offer a thank-offering to the gods who guided my arm to your preservation. . . . This altar, great Jupiter! be yours — that one, Minerva’s — and that one, Mercury’s.

Cassiopeia.
Also from me, let smoke offerings rise on these altars — offerings of repentance and gratitude.

Cepheus.
Perseus! not yet enough reward — With Andromeda’s hand, receive also my crown. People! — hear it, faithful people! — Perseus, your rescuer — your god of protection, shall also be your ruler. —

The People.
Let Perseus rule — Let Andromeda rule.

(Perseus and Andromeda join hands, father and mother place theirs on their shoulders, the maidens and youths crown them with garlands of flowers, the priests offer sacrifices, the people express their joy through gestures, and thus the curtain falls.)
