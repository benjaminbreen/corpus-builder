ad upon her shoulder, 
ve a little cry. Clayton 

.| My name. 

“] HAVE BEEN MOST MISERABLY SEA SICK. 
WHY DID YOU SEARCH FOR ME?” 

threw down the book and crosseti the 
aisle. 

“What is the matter?” he a. ad. 
“Why do. you annoy this lady?” 

“This ain’t no lady. She 's a confi- 
dence queen,” said the detective rough- 
ly. “Don’t you come butting in or 

- we'll have to run you in too.” 

“There’s some mistake here,” Olay- 

ton said quietly. “I presume are 
2) Rar ce ar 
from his pocket and passed it to Clay- 
ton. It recited that Loa Cogswell, 
alias Pfeffer, alias Hay, alias Goodrich, 
‘was wanted tn Chicago for swindling. 
She was supposed to be making her 
escape to London or Paris; The de- 
scription in a general way fitted the 
girl, but Clayton saw that some mis- 
take had been made. He had been 
looking at the girl all the afternoon, 
and he would have sworn that she was 
no criminal. That her distress was real 
was apparent. 

“This is all wrong,” he said decided- 
ly. “That description would fit hun- 
dreds of women who have passed 
through this station today. If you ar- 
rest Miss Ormonde, you will be sued 
for false imprisonment. I know her 
to be the person she says she is.” 

“One of her pals, eh?” sneered the 
detective. “I guess we’d better take 
you too.” 

Clayton handed the man a card. 

“If you want to mess things up still 
further,” he sajd quietly, “go ahead.” 

The officer looked at the card. ' “Got 

any letters to back this up?’ he de- 
manded. Clayton produced several 
from his coat. The detective touched 
his hat. 
' “[ guess we made a mistake,” he 
said uncertainly. “Sorry we troubled 
the lady. I hope this will go no fur 
ther, sir.” 

“It’s all right, I suppose,” was the 

careless answer. “If Miss Ormonde 
will excuse you, I have nothing more 
to say.” 
, The girl bowed her willingness, and 
the two men filed sheepishly out of the 
car. Arresting a confidence queen was 
one thing. Mistaking a friend of the 
son of the governor of the stat® was 
quite another. They were glad they 
were let off so easily. 

Una turned to Clayton. 

“I am very much obliged to you,” she 
said softly. “I don’t know what I 
should have done had they taken me 
off the train. I am to gail in the morn- 
ing with Uncle Jim and a party of 
friends. Father sent him a draft for 
my expenses, and I dhould have landed 
in New York without funds or friends 
had I been detained.” 

“T am glad to have been of service,” 
Cjayton said. “May I sit down here 
for a few minutes? You see, the other 
passengers are looking, and since I so 
boldly claimed acquaintance it would 
look odd if I returned to my own seat.” 

“It was a daring thing to do,” she 
smiled. “How do you know that I 
am not this confidence queen ?”’ 

“That's easy,” he declared. “You do 
not look the part. I think I am a bet- 
ter judge of human nature than the 
chaps with the badges.” 

She bowéd-her acknowledgment of 
the complimen | 

“I should hate to fee] that I looked 
iike @ swindler,” she laughed. 

“You look more like an angel,” he | 
eaid daringly and looking into the clear 
eyes. “It was that that first attracted 
my attention.” : 
_ “I saw you looking several times,” 

Clayton . Somehow the gir! 
had made an impression on him when 
she first came intd\the car. It was 
pleasant to think that she, too, bad 
been Interested: The thought gave 
him and almost before they 
rea it the porter began to brush 
the passengers down. 

“Mercy!” she cried. “1 did not know 
that time was paésing so. We are al- 
most in New York.” 

“I wish we were headed the other 
way,” he sald regretfully. “May I call 
before you go?” 

“T sail in the morning,” she said. “I 
am sorry that I cannot say yes. You 
see, I don’t know what plans have 

been made for this evening, and it | 

might not look well to have you calling 
when I cannot explain.” 

“May I write?” he asked eagerly. “1 
do not want to have you elip right out 
of my life.” 

“IT think It would be better,” she said 
slowly. “I wish you would even forget 
I—I cannot explain.” 

“T'll think of you as Mile. Alias,” he 
said promptly. “Your double had so 
many names that 1 shall pretend that 
you are she.” 

They had risen and were standing 

on the platform of the Pullman. She | 

put her hand in his. 

“Perhaps I am,” she said softly. 
“Thank you so much for your kind- 
ness, and goodby.” 

She had slipped down the steps and 
was lost in the crowd before Clayton 
had recovered from the audacity of 
that last speech He knew that it 
could not be true, yet for a moment the 
suggestion shocked him. He hurried 
down the platform after her, but the 
boats were just leaving their slips as 
he passed through the gate, and she 
was lost, 

For weoks Clayton puzzled over that 
speech. He knew very well that she 
was not the swindler, yet why did she 
choose to create that doubt? The more 
he reasoned the more puzzled he be- 
came. Only one fact stood unchanged. 
He loved her. That was certain. 

Business called him to London, and 
there, away from-his friends, he came 
to his decision, When his business af- 
fairs were straightened out he would 
go straight to Detroit and ‘see if he 
could locate the Ormondes. 

But he did not have to wait that long. 
He took the boat at Southampton, and 
at Cherbourg the passengers from Par- 
is came on board. Cldyton, leaning 
over the rai] on the upper deck, saw a 
figure ascending the gangway that 
caused his heart to beat faster, 

It could be none other than Mlle. 
Alias. He burried down to the lower 

deck,.. but a al and, 
“ > pam 3@ Lea 
name, two days h kked for her 

in vain. 

Then, late in the evening, a wan little 
figure was helped out on deck and es— 
tablished in a steamer chair. Clayton 
hurried toward her. 

“I have been looking for you for two 
days,” he said when greetings had been 
exchanged. “Where have you conceal- 
ed yourself?” 

“In my berth.” she explained. “I 
have. been most miserably seasick. 
Why did you search for me?” 

“I wanted to ask you to become my 
wife,” he said directly. 

“Not knowing whether I am a con- 
fidence worker or not?’ she demanded. 

“Knowing in my heart that you are 
not,” he corrected, “why did you seek 
to raise such a doubt?” 

“As a test,” she said. “Had you not 
belleved in me you would have lost 
interest, and I wanted to see”— 

“Are you content?” he asked as his 
hand closed over hers, “I have never 
lost faith.” 

She spoke no word, yet Olayton knew 
that he had won, and he bent and kiss- 
ed her.

What Books Do, 
Books are friends whose society is 
extremely agreeable to me. They are 

of all ages and of every country. They ' 

have distinguished themselves both in 
the cabinet and in the field and ob- 

tained high honors for their knowledge | 

of the sciences. It is easy to gain ac- 
cess to them, for they are always at 
my’ service, and I admit them to my 
company and dismiss them from it 
whenever I please. They are never 
troublesome, but immediately answer 
every question I ask them. Some re- 
late to me the events of past ages, 
while others reveal to me the secrets 
of nature. Some teach me how to live 
and others bow to die, Some, by their 
vivacity, drive away my cares and ex- 
bilarate my spirits, while others give 
fortitude to my mind and teach me the 
important lesson bow to restrain my 
desires and depend wholly on myself. 
They open to me, in short, the various 
avenues of all the arts and sciences, 
and upon their information I safely 
rely in all emergencies. In return for 
all these services they only ask me 
to accommodate them with a conven- 
lent chamber in some corner-ah.my 
humble habitation, where they May 
repose in peace, for these friends are 
more delighted by the tranquillity of 
retirement than with the tumults of 
society.—-Francesco Petrarca.

thought a party wrap would be extrav-

Cinnamon makes an unusual and 
appetizing flavor for gelatin desserts 
and has the additional virtue of econ- 
omy. Serve with sweet cream, plain 
or whipped. 

When frying onions, water may be 
added at the beginning, and after they 

have simmered tender the water 
should be turned off and fat added for 
the frying. This process removes the 
— onion juice and makes them 

nder.

that need filling, and so we must needs

Go to a reliable hair dealer and see

chignon puff-as being the most satis-

little wire frame with four or five 
puffs, which can be dressed daily. 

Women who are blessed with curly 
hair by nature should never cease to 
give thanks for it, and since curls are 
desirable, whether natural or artificial, 
buy your finger puffs of curly hair. | 

If your pompadour is prone to fall 
flat or droop into ‘ugly. lines, the finger 
puffs—more especially the ones made 
from curly hair—can be ruffled up and 
pinned under the hair as pompadour 
plumpers. They are lighter, more com- ! 
fortable and giye a far prettier and 
more graceful effect than any of the 
numerous “rats” that have been worn 
so long. The illustration shows one of 
the latest and smartest of the new 
evening coiffures. 

Nevel Guest Book. i 

A tactful hostess in order to make 
her guests comfortable must know. 
their little fads and peculiarities. A 
new kind of book which is a great 
help to a hostess is called a guest book, 
The hostess bas in this volume the 
names of all' those who are or who are 
likely to be guests at her home, and| 
beside their names aré written the lit-' 
tle peculiarities, which she must re-| 
member if she hopes to make them!

Many of these bear upon the subject: 
of fads and fancies in diet, for num-| 
bers of people are vegetarians, others!

of other kinds or blends, while others 
perhaps require a glass of hot water 
to drink before they go to bed. | 

Instead of Ribbons. | 

The mother of a small girl whose, 
ability to lose hair ribbons was a’ 
source of constant worry solved the 
problem by using strips of plain or, 
flowered muslin. | 

These she hemmed neatly, making 

the loss of one of them did not mean) 
6o serious a thing as if a brand new 
hair ribbon had disappeared. | 
Of course these little muslin ties 
were not used for “dress up” occa- 
sions, but for ordinary home wear they 
proved to be as satisfactory as they 
were inexpensive.

The Good Shepherd. 

Provided a person about to embark 
in sheep keeping were to inquire 
what. would be his first essential in 
making a start in that industry I 
should answer, ‘Develop a kind and 
patient disposition.” In reality it is 
practically useless for a man possess- 
ed of a hard heart and cruel temper 
to pay long prices for blooded stock 
or short prices for culls. He will suc- 
ceed with neither in case he gives the 
flock his personal care. The sheep, 
ing a nervous, timid creature, cannot. 
thrive under abuse. The man who 
‘whose stock wins the purple and blue 
in the show ring, you 
man who treats his stock as they 
should be treated—with kindness. 
Stock will ever respond to kind treat- 
ment. It is the best “feed” you cap |

Short Rotation of Crops. 

Every farmer realizes the value of 
a short rotation of crops in maintain-, 
ing the fertility of the soil. Yet it, 
is not at all uncommon to seed to, 
timothy and clover and mow the field; 
for three or four consecutive years. 
till every vestige of »clover has dis 
appeared and nearly all the value 
the clover plant as a renovator of 
the soil is lost, says a writer in Ohi 
Farmer. I believe sowing timothy 
with the clover is all right. I alwa: 
practice it. Then I am quite sure of; 
a catch, and I get more and better 
hay. There are also other advantage) © 
which space forbids I should enumer-, 
ate here. I believe, though, that the 
meadow should be mowed but once’ 
and never more than twice before 

ploughing.

HOW BILEANS PURIFY THE 
BLOOD 

Spring pimples, boils, skin rashes 
aod eruptiong are just now rampant. 
The most scientific corrective . and 
blood purifier is Bileans, the he2bal 
remedy. Mr. Thos. Hesselwood, an 
employee of- the Consumers’ Gas Co., 
Toronto, says: ‘‘Bileans are the best 
blood purifier and liver corrective I 
have ever met with. Pimples and 
boils broke out all over my neck. M 
blood seemed absolutely filled wi 
impurities and poisons. My liver 
was disordered, too, and I was dull, 
weak and ailing. Bileans purified my 
dlood and cured the boils and pim- 
ples; they also toned up my system 
—gave me vim and energy, and filled 
me with life and vigor!’ 

Reader, Bileans can do the same 
for you! All druggists and _ stores 
sell them at.50 cents a box, or from 
Bilean Co., Toronto, for price. 6 boxes 
for $2.50. Send one cent stamp for

An instructor in a certain boys’

One of the youthful students, after 
struggling over a particularly strenu-

came upon the following query, which

“Name twelve animals of the polar 
regions.” 

The youngster scratched his head, 
thought hard for many minutes, and 
finally, under the spell of a sudden 
inspiration, wrote: 

“Six seals and six polar bears.”’ 

The professor was so pleased with 
the pupil’s cleverness that he mark- 
ed his paper 100 per cenit.

BUYING FURNITURE. 

The Antique Styles and the Modern 
Reproductions. : 

It is always best never to buy old 
furniture that bas been “restored,” ac- 
cording to Town and Country, except 
by a master hand, unless, of course, 
you are merely buying a piece of fur- 
niture and not a specimen. Again, it 
is just as advisable to buy good rep ‘o- 

ductions that are old enough to have ( 7 

attained that stage of glow which is 
the beauty of old furniture. Nine- 
tenths of the mahogany furniture of 
the eighteenth century is not worth us- 
ing for regular household wear, be- 
cause {It has generally seen its day. 
lt is therefore folly to spend a lot of 
money on genuine Chippendale chairs, 
for instance, for daily use in a dining 
rooni. . 

The sound thing to do for dining 
rooms is to have oak chairs and fit- 
tings. Oak survives all the ages. But 
in the case of this wood, as in every- 
thing else, the modern requirements 
are confronted with a difficulty. Bv- 
ery modern dinipg room insists on be- 
ing supplied with a sideboard: In the 

| Jacobean days the sideboard, n= we 
understand it, was unknown. So, too, 
was the hatrack, and yet in a magnifi- 
cently established house was a con- 
traption which the proud proprietor 
was willing to take his oath was “a 
Jacobean hat and umbrella rack.” In 
any case, it was so sold to him by a 
firm of antique furniture dealers. 

CULINARY CONCEITS. 

Pumpkins are much better when 
steamed than when boiled. 

Salmon which is to be fed to an in- 
valid should be wrapped in greased 
paper and lightly broiled. ' 

Fat skimmed from the water in 
which bacon or meat has been boiled

Hot soups flush the face, especially 
if the skin is delicate. Starchy foods, 
sucb as potatoes, ought always to be 

Buy best joints for roasting. For 
boiling and stewing the highest priced 
joints need not be bought, but each 
should be suitable: for its purposes. 
Long stewing will make the toughest 
meat tender. 

A &tock pot on the back of the kitch- 
en range into which bone, gristle and 
trimmings of any kind of meat may 
be put will serve well for making soup 
or gravy for meat which has been 
cooked the second time. 

Getting All the Good. 

“Do you always leave your piano up 
so that the keys will show?” asked the 
visitor of the happy looking woman. 

“Yes,” returned she. “I make it a 
point to use everything in the house 
every day of my life, to hide away 
nothing, trying to keep it nice for 
company. It is I who am living here, 
not the company. I had enough of

Wo it thoroughly. Many tops of stoves 

receive 4 daily polish, and yet the sides 

are covered with dust and grease. Let

will have a purer flavor. Never leave 
dust or grease remains of former bak- 
ings op your oven doors. A newspa-

The human body was first supposed 
@o be made up of 208 bones, but later 
discoveries have developed the fact 
that it contains 208 Bones and an ap- 
pendix. An appendix is something 
which is added on, ‘like a postscript on 
a woman’s letter, and means about as 
much. Its principal us* is to afford a

aur town who has nothing left in her

May our Sunday school text was, 
“Praise the Lord, oh, my soul, and all 
that is within me.” I said to pa, 
“Mrs, So-and-so wouldn’t be very

THE GOVERNMEN

SURVEY OUT FROM FORT WIL- 
LIAM TAKES A SUPPLY OF 
THIS USEFUL BALM. 

Zam-Buk, the favorite household 
balm and salve, is now adopted as 
“The Doctor” by leading parties en- 
gaged in ri oe various parts of 
the Dominion lands. 

Mr. Henry Hall, writing from Fort 
William, says: ‘‘Having proved how 
beneficial Zam-Buk is in cases of 
cuts, skin injuries and diseases, I de- 
termined to keep a supply handy. 
Being engaged to go on a survey, I 
thought it would a most useful 
thing to take along. I obtained a 
supply in Fort William and very well 
it was I did so. I may say that 
pretty nearly every day it was called 
into requisition by one or other of 
the party for cuts, bruises, burns, or 
some injury or other. It is wonder- 
ful how quickly Zam-Buk takes the 
soreness out of cuts, burns, bruises 
and injuries; and on our survey it 
earned golden opiniuns from all who 
had oceasion to if it. I have found 
it very fine for gkin disease, and 
can strongly recommend it as a house- 
hold balm.” . 

Mr. Lascelles Scott, one of the lead- 
ing Government analysts, says: “I 
have no hesitation in certifying the 
entire purity of Zam-Buk, which in 
my opiniof.is excellently adapted for 
skin injuries and diseases.” Zam- 
Buk cures cuts, scalds, burns, bruises, 
eczema, scalp sores, ringworm, ul- 
cers, abscesses, chapped laces, 
Spring pimples, blood poison, chronic 
abeosaead, etc. As ar embrocation

‘vife, he needs no bookkeeper or man- 
ager; she will be there from morning 
‘ill night, the slave of the ledger, 
rareful of every centime, while he, 
too, often will deave the heavier part 
of the business in her capable hands 
and turn his attention ,to a domine

A royal almoner was an ecclesiastic

it was always a dish of plain weat, 
with no seasoning. Sometimes special 
dishes of odds and ends, the leavings

and pure this elose confinement wears 
on her health. Her strength will 
fail; she may lose her appetite, ‘be-

is in danger of a general breakdown. 
Such was the condition of Miss Marie 
Anne Fleury, of Ste. Anne de la Per- 
ade, Que., before she used Dr. Wil- 
liams’ Pink Pills. She says: |, “For 
a number of years I have been a 
servant. Up to a year ago I always 
enjoyed the best of health, but sud- 
denly I was seized with pains in my 
side, my appetite left me, I became 
dyspeptic and lost all strength. I 
consulted a doctor who told me I was 
suffering from general debility. I was 
forced to stop work and for three 
months I followed the doctor’s treat- 
ment, but without benefit. I was ad- 

I| vised to try Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, 

and as I had often. read of the cases 
they cured, I decided to do so. I 
only took eight boxes before I was 
cured and today I am stronger than 
I ever was. My digestion is good and 
I pits now go about my work with- 
out fatigue. I owe a debt of grati- 
tude|to Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for 
what they have done for me and T 
strongly advise other weak

Migs Fleury’s case is one of many 
that Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have 
cured after doctors’ help had failed.

fact that they strike right at

A Kiss 

By MARY BRAY 

Btily kissed her, {t had not been ‘en-

and,she had Jayghed and teased him. 
Then it happened, ahd she had struck 
and 

scratching her arms on the blackberry 
thorns, ‘until she broke’ into an open 
space where one might stop to,breathe. 
Bhe paused, then flung herself upon the 
ground, preasing hot hands to warm, 
flushed cheeks. 4

PLAN OF ACTION. 

find her. She waited quite a time, but 

he did not come, and at last, with a 

sigh, she remembered the blackberry 

pail and rose to her feet. 

It was a large pall, holding five ga)- 

lons, and was much less than half 
filled. Not trace her steps 
she open and pressed on to 

a blackberry patch farther away, one 
to which they seldom came, The day 
was blistering hot, and when the last 
glistening berry had heaped the pail 
she lifted it with tired purpled fingers 
arid started home, carrying in her heart 
the feeling of a disappointing day. 

It was quite a distance to the farm- 
house, and the girl hesitated; consider- 
ing which would be the shortest route, 
finally deciding upon a path not much 
Weed at that point, but communi- 
cating with the country road. 

She had gone but a, short distancé on 
the path when a crunching step in the 
woods startled her, and a minute later 
a@ man stepped out from the trees, 
started at seeing her, grinned amlably 
and walked to her side. She stified the 
first impulse to scream. There was no 
one near to hear, and it. might be dan- 
gerous to show fright. So plucky Mar- 
tha concealed her alarm and walked 
quietly on her way. 

“Lemme carry the pail,” he said, 
“It’s too heavy for you.” — ‘ 

“I can carry it,” said Martha. 

“Maybe you can, but I will,” be re 
sponded aad took it from her. 

Rapidly she tried to form a mental 

plan of action, She could not shake off. 

the instinctive feeling that the man 
meant harm, yet she knew the abso- 
lute futility of crying out or trying to 
run from him. If she could keep him 
from molesting her further until the 
path joined the county road she would 
be reasonably sqfe, as wagons and 
buggies passed there quite continually. 

He began ‘to talk, inquiring about the 
principal farmers around the vicinity 
—whs they were, the best roads, the 
distances to towns-—and she answered, 
never ceasing to be painfully alert, 
never slacking speed, 

“Here, quit that pace!” he suddenly 
exclaimed ro y, putting one arm 
around her waist in a firm grasp. “You 
needn’t try to run away from me, and 
I’m not going to run with you, Cut it 
out.” 

Her heart almost stood still. Then 
it flashed upon her that, somewhere 
near, another path ran from this one 

ed little cabin. Th«' ‘ \ stood open she 
knew. That the could be closed 
and barred sb- w, having once

dently, like a Ughtning flash, came the 
query, “Who was the man In the cab 
in?” and & new terror seized her, 
‘Then her flesh quivered at the sound 
of @ horrihle cry and two almost sfmul- 
taneous shots, followed by a third. 
How 'long she lay where sire had 

fallen she did not know, for now 

fright and exhaustion seemed to have 
numbed her utterly, but when she was 
able to struggle to her feet she crept 
through the woods toward the old path 
leading to the country road, avoiding 
with a shudder the crooked path whia 
led froni the cabin. Finally she sat 
down by the wayside to wait for any 
passing vehicle; too spent to carry her- 
self farther. And this time Billy, also 
disappointed, carrying his load of ber- 
ries, came strolling ‘along. 

“Martha!” 

At sight of the limp; bedraggled fig- 
‘ure he crigd out and fell at her side, 
She told him weakly what had hap- 
pened, and, aflame with revengeful 
rage, he marched down the crooked 
‘path, leaving her for a minute alone. 
‘When he came back his usually ruddy 
face was white, though he would not 
give any explanation, and not until 
Billy had carried her home in his 
strong young arms and she had cried 
upon his shoulder and let him kiss her 
peacefully, rapturously, did he tell he: 
that he had stumbled upon two dead 
bodies, dead, but warm, not five yards 
from each other, though separated by 
shrubbery and trees. 

It transpired that the men were no- 
torious criminals in hiding. - When 
Martha had staggered in with her cry 
of “He'll kill us! Run!” the startled 
man in the cabin acted upon one idea— 
that he was about to be captured; that 
‘she, had warned him. He had rushed 
out, fired at, the figure approaching 
throngh the woods, and his shot was 
almost instantly returned. Both men 
had shot to kill 

Asa curious beneficence from so har- 
rowing an experience, the prize money 
paid for the delivery of the two crim- 
inals, alive or dead, gave a certain 
young couple a splendid start in the 
building of their new home. 

¢ Duke Wellin 

“tady POF NEN tells us 
the second Duke of Wellington was a 
very clever and witty man, whom in- 
dolence or pride prevented from tak- 
ing part in politics or anything else. 
He certainly was eccentric in man- 
ners and dress, generally wearing “an 
old soft felt hat and an aged cloak of 
the sort known as a roquelaure, a huge 
cape of black cloth, and this, com- 
bined with his goggles, made him a 
figure of a very noticeable and eceen- 
tric kind.” One day the duke drove 
Lady Dorothy - Nevill down to the 
Crystal: palace to see an exhibition of 
donkeys, and when there his grace 
would insist on strolling about in the 
inclosure reserved for judges. Lady 
Dorothy told him they would be turn- 
ed. out and left him. Presently an 
official approached,.and said, “Sir, may 
I ask, are you a judge?” “A judge of 
what?’ thundered the duke. “Of. don- 
keys,” came the reply. “Certainly I 
am and (looking bard at the man) a 
very good one too. Leave me alone.” 
The man slunk back abashed, and 
there was more whispered consulta: 
tion among the officials.. But the queer 
intruder was recognized by somebody, 
and with many bows and apologies the 
Duke of Wellington was invited to 
become a judge, to which he agreed 
with much chuckling.—Saturday Be

can hold the folds and give a balance 
to her figure that it would otherwise

Carrying a full gathered skirt, such 
as is often worn to the opera; recep” 
tions and for dinners, Is quite a simple 
matter, for it is nothing more than 
making a bag by folding the ends of 
a handkerchief together. 

The skirt is picked ‘up with thumbs 
and forefingers at the back by the bot- 
tom or edge of the hem and straight- 
ened out at the waist line, while the 
hands are extended ‘as far to right and 
left as they will reach. When the ma- 
terial has been settled in folds around 
the waist, with one hand holding the 
two sides together in front,' the. skirt 
fs caught up directly in the middle of 
the front, and the three edges are held 
firmly in either the right or left hand. 
Held in this way under an opera cape 
or long cloak, a frock with a train or 
one that is unusually long can be man- 
aged with little difficulty.—Exchange. 

HOME DRESSMAKING. 

Avoiding the Long Strain of Standing 

to Have a Skirt Hung. . 
I am sure this will help home dress- 
makers, Finish the skirt all but the 
bem, put it on and adjust it properly. 
Take a yardstick, place one end on the 
floor close to the feet and allow the 
stick to rest against the front of the 
rkirt. Mark the top of the stick on 
the skirt with a pin. Move the stick 
along to the side, being careful to see 
that it is always vertical and not

, and place another pin. Pro- 
in this way till a circle of pins is 
pleted around the skirt. Now the 
skirt is marked an even thirty-six inch- 
es from the floor. Take it off, lay it on’ 
a table and with the yardstick mark 
off the desired length below the row of 
pins. I usually allow thirty-four and 
one-half inches, which is one and one 
half inches off the ground. The pins 
can be very quickly placed even by a 
man, who seems to find no objection to 
the yardstick, and it does away with 
the long strain of standing to have a 
ekirt hung.—Good Housekeeping. 

Soul Loveliness. 
Near acquaintance with loveliness 
shows whether it is genuine or not. ‘It 

is the kind of beauty that bears daily , 

inspection that lasts to and through 
o}d age. One may have perfect fea- 
a dazzling skin, ideally perfect 
teeth, a wonderfully graceful figure, 
but if one is fretful, whining, childish, 
‘selfish or arrogant—well, what's the 
use of the beauty part? The spirit 
must manifest itself with beautiful 
thoughts and beautiful acts, else the 
physical perfections will appear abso- 
lutely ugly and tiresome. Many a wo-

may stick several pipes in her mouth

feet and throw sticks from twen 
inches to two feet in length, trying

You can form two sides, making it

INDIAN “WIRELESS.” 

The Smoke Signals and Fire Arrows: 

f 

Ages before Marconi invented wire 
less telegraphy the Indians of North 
America had a system of “wireless” 
communication of their own by meang 
of smoke signals and fire arrows. 

The settlers wife, looking out from: 
her lonely cabin on the prairie at the 
band of roving Indians, learned to note. 
and understand the Indian smoke sig- 
nals puffing lightly into the clear bl 
of the prairie sky. These smoke s 
nals were sent up in puffs or rings, so 
that there was no chance of mistaking 
them for a campfire. The puffs were 
made by covering a fire with a blanket 
for a minute. Then the blanket wasl 
lifted quickly, and the smoke ascend 
ed. The blanketing process was re4 
peated until a column of rings wa 
the Indians far and near to “look out 
Two smokes 
built . close together meant “Cam 
here.” 

Signaling at night was carried on 
means of fire arrows. Their eticencs | 
was like that of the smokes. The ral 
trail left by the arrow in its fligh 
through the darkness was the same 
signal as one smoke. The others tal- 
lied, and a flight of several fiery ar+ 
rows said, “The enemy is too strongf 
for us.” | 

How Plants Travel. 

The dandelion, with its parachuted 
has gone with Peary within the arctie

ance in the southern hemisphere. The 
rose of Jericho curls up in a ball, withd 
the seed pod inside and the wind rolls 
it over the deserts of Syria and Kgypt: 
The seed pods of the furze and broon# 
are like little guns. In August and 
September you may hear them

Nawoalenet Postage Increased. 

At tbe recent postal conference be- 
tween Canada and the United States, it 
was decided to raise the rate on news- 
papers passing between the two coun- 
tries All Canadian papers have been 
notified by the Deputy Postmaster Gen- 
eral that the new arrangement goes into 
effect immediately and that after May 8 
all Canadiap vewspapers will be required 
to place a one cent stamp on each news- 
paper going to the, United States. A 
low pound rate has heretofore been io 
force, and this the newspaper men paid 
without extra charge to the subscribers, 
but this new rate is so heavy that we 
cannot afford to pay it, hence muat raise

of our subscribers in the U. 8. to this 
matter. If you are in arrears on sub-

Try This For Your Cough, 

To relieve a cough or break up a cold | 
io twenty-four hours, the following simple , 
formula, the ingredients of which can be | 
obtained of any good prescription drug | 
gist at sriall cost, is all that is required: 
Virgin Oil of Pine (Pure), one-half ounce; | 
Glycerine, two ounces; good Whisky, a| 
half\pint. Shake well and take in tea- 

spoonful doses every four hours. The de-| , 

sired results can not be obtained unless 
the ingredients are pure. It is therefore | 
better to purebase the ingredients sep | 
arately and prepare the wixtuse yourself, | 
Virgin Oil of Pine (Pure) should be pur. | 
chased in the original balf-ounce vials, | 
which druggists buy for dispensing. | 

Bach vial is securely sealed in a round | 
wooden case which protects the Oil from | 
exposure tajight. Around the wooden 
case is an engraved wrapper with the 

name-—Virgin Oil. of Pine (Pure)’+ 
plainly printed thereon. There are many 
inatiations and cheap productions of 

Pine, bat these goly create nausea, and 
never effect the desired results, ,
