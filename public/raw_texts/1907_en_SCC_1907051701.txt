It was impossible nnder the previons

vailed that he had received notice of the 
Intended raise in the rent, and he askod 
the Board to interest itself in getting an 
Increased allownnee for rent from the 
Department. At the present time, when 
the income is adjostet monthly and the 
Postmaster knows where he is at. the

thatthe Western members had been 
auitating for exme time for increases for 
western offices The Department had 
conceded that if the revenue of any 
office showed an inereareduaring a period 
of three mouthe, then She approoria-

A proposition had been made that 
the motion of Dr. Meintyre should 
be amended by fixing the rate of 
transportation at three cents a mile 
west of Fort William, and two cents 
& mile cast of that point, but De 
Mcintyre had refused to alter his 
motion to thin effect aw le did pot 
believe there was a chance that the 

amended proposal could te put 
through the House, 

During the winter Dr. McIntyre 
war 

also on the committees dealing 
with the question of tne alleged 
lumber combine in the West, and se 
veral weeks were devoted to this im- 
portant work A large amount of 

this evidenc® was taken by the com: | 

mittee and certain recommendations 
were made to the @ouse The cost 
of lumber was certainly very high in 
the west and the diMeulty of obtain 
img it wan one of the serious draw 
backa in connection with the devel- 
opment of the country, 

One solution of the lumber diMfcul 
ty, the doctor suggested, might be 
the appointment of an expert who 
would have accons to the books = of 
account of the several firma in. the 
business with powers similar to 
thone of any Government Departinen 
tal office to investigate and report 
to =the government so that aetion 
might be taken when the legal ma 
chinery looking to the enforcement 
of laws yet to be put into the sta. 
tutebook are enacted The doctor 
Stated that the Lumber Combine 
Commission had no authority to 
punish the Combinesters not even 
to say whether or not the Combine 
which they have reported was in 
existence, was a Combine in re- 
straint of trade, They simply = in- 
vestigated for the purpose of find- 
ing out whether there was a com: 
bine, and having done that their 
work was complete and future 
action in the matter rests with the 
Government, The whole question, 
saya the Doctor, is a diMeuit 
to solve, 

Tn reierence to the Insurance Com- 
mission yeport, the member for 
Strathcona said that the next ses 
rion would likely sce some tangible 
enactments in regard to the matter, 
He had nothing to say in regard to 
the personal remarks between mem- 
hers and ministers which were the 
outcome of the discussion. In regard 
to the question of extension of the 
question and the extension of the 
©.N.R. into Strathcona, Dr, MeIn 
tyre said that he had taken the 
ground that the place to curtail the 
new extensions of the big roada was 
in the Hast where they were making 
Hereulaen efforts to establish — lines 
fo competing points, and not in the 
West, where the lines proposed = were 
through territory, as yet unserved 
by any railway for many milea, In 
cidentally the Doctor remarked that 
the 
force on May 1fth 

Dr, MeIntyre also had charge ot 
the bill permitting the O.P.R. to 
construct their line from Camrose to 
Strathcona. He says in that con- 
nection that the company will not 

construct that branch until their line | 

is through to Wetaskiwin which will 
| likely be next.sumauner. The Redis- 
|tribution Bill for the Western pro-

ed the opinion that Honeyford and 
all his tik were frauds and they 
should be in the penetentiary, The

said the mill man ought to have his

he woukl be pleased to have the

Elyvie’s 
Little Miracle 

By Anna Steese Richardson 

| Copyright, 1908, by May MeKeon 

It was pretty generally understood 
that the Billy Daltons were drifting 
apart. There was no particular reason 
for this state of affairs, save the lack 
of something better to do, 

You see, they had Just enough money 
so that Billy did not have to work nor 
Janet to worry about making both ends 
meet. They had danced thelr way 
through several seasons Into a lazy, 
good humored and comrade-like engage- 
ment, thence Into matrimony, After 
that Billy had continued to lead co- 
tillons and Janet to dance them, but 
generally with other partners, 

Matters between them had reached 
the point where the rumor laden socl- 
ety papers had suggested covertly that 
when Billy went to England and Scot- 
land, where he had nothing In partie. 
ular to do, Janet would probably take 
up her home tn Nevada or South Da- 
kota, there to remain until Norman 
Stanley returned from Africa, where 
he was fighting ennul by hunting big 
game. It was even whispered that 
Billy Dalton had insinuated to Stanley 
that It was rather better taste to stalk 
big game than another man's wife, es 
pecially when the other man was per- 
fectly willing to make It clear sailing 
for hia wife if it would make her any 
bappter. 

Of course, this sounds a bit strong on 
paper, particularly to the old fashioned 
folk who still believe that marriage Is 
& contract for life and not a mere epl- 
sode, In the set to which the Billy Dal- 
tons belonged the situation was ac. 
cepted as a matter of course, and when 
Janet asked a lot of people down to 
their Long Island place for the auto 
mobile races and the week end no one 
thought of refusing just because the 
Daltons might separate within a fort 
night after the gathering. 

Such was the situation when the 
Dalton car broke down on the Jericho 
turnpike, and its occupants—Janet, 
Mra, Greenwalt, Joe Jeffreys and 
“Marsh” Huntoon—decided to cut 
through the woods to the Dalton place 
and leave the car for a farmer to guard 
until the mechanic who handled the 
Dalton garage could be dispatched to 
the scene of the accident, 

Perhaps it was not entirely Impa- 
thence which led them to take the 
short cut through the woods, but the 
call of a hundred autumn volees In 
rustling leaves, rich, warm colorings 
and the chatter of squirrels laying up 
winter stores. And thus it was that 
they suddenly stopped in their tracks 
and listened to a sound that was not 
of the woods, but of the nursery—the 
plaintive wall of a child, Janet it was 
who found It-—a bit of white faced, 
staring eyed humanity rolled up snug. 
ly In a great shawl of Iceland wool. 

While she beld the baby in her arms 
and tried to allence ite walle with un- 
certain and awkward little pettings the 
quartet beld a conference, The child 
was too young to bave walked there, 
Mrs. Greenwalt sald it was not a day 
over two months old. It was too far 
from the road to be heard by passing 
travelers, Ab-—there waa the answer, 
a wiep of paper ted to the end of the 
shawl 

“Please take care of little Elsie, It 
was not her fault that she came into 
the world, and I ean do no more.” 

“I've always aald that the govern. 
ment ought to regulate the question of 
marriage among the poor,” remarked 
Mra. Greenwalt severely, “Here ls a 
case in point,” 

“You are Jumping at conclusions,” 
sald Huntoon dryly, “Let's take it to 
the town marshal”. 

“And what then?” asked Janet with- 
out lifting her gaze from the child's 
face, The baby had clutched her fin- 
ger with Ite tiny fet and settled down 
an If it had found anchorage, 

“Ob, there are asylums and homes 
for youngsters like this, You'd better 
hurry along bome with It before It be- 
ging to bowl One of your men can 
take It to town before dark, Shall I 
carry the little beggar for you?’ 

“Ob, no, She's not a bit heavy, and 
she is quiet now, She might cry if we 
changed her position.” 

They trudged on through rustling 
leaves and soft Indian summer haze, 
three of the party chatting gayly; two, 
the young wife and the baby, looking 
into each other's eyes as if searching 
for a new key to the problem of life, 
Bometimes Janet wished that the child 
would close its eyes, She did not like 
to meet that trustful, clear eyed gaze, 

. ° . ° . . e 

“Have you disposed of the young: 
ster?’ asked “Marsh” Huntoon as they 
sat down to dinner that night, 

Janet started and looked across the 
table at her husband, He lifted his 
eyebrows tnquiringly. 

Huntoon's good humored laugh broke 
the awkward allence, 

“What? Don't you know that our 
party was increased by one during our 
ride this afternoon? Rather a small 
‘one,’ but, my, what lungs {t has!" 

Janet drew in ber breath sharply. 

“I wish you would not talk any more 
about it at present, good people,” she 
sald, trying to speak lightly. “I've 
started inquiries In a quiet way, I 
don't want the thing to get Into the 
papers—because if no one claims little 
Hisie I think I-—I shall keep her." 

“Keep her!’ gasped Mrs, Greenwalt. 
“Why, my dear girl, the place for a 
child without a name is a foundling 
asylum,” 

danet spoke very softly, yet every 
word was beard, so complete was the 
allence, 

“I shall give her @ name because— 
once—Just unce-—I saw a line of chil- 
dren walking, rows and rows, by twos, 
from an orphan asylum, I can’t send 
her there.” 

Mentally she saw again those clear, 
trusting blue eyes, 

“And I know you will all be kind 

enough to keep this very quiet until’ 
there was just a slight, tense hesita- 
tlon—“untll we decide what shall be 
done.” 

Naturally it was talked about, bow-

the crucial moment? 

Within the Dalton bungalow on Long 
Island stranger things were happen- 
ing. No clew to the baby's parents 
had been found. When Billy Dalton 
dropped down occasionally, as be had 
been déing for a year past to keep up 
appearances, his first question was, 
“Anything new?" and this always 
meant “anything new about the baby's 
history.” And little Elsie would look 
up at him with reproachful blue eyes 
as if asking, “Why do you care?” And 
the worst of it was that Billy Dalton 
began to realize that he didcare. Janet 
had changed, and, with an odd sort 
of jealousy, he realized that it was I't- 
tle Elsie and not he who had brought 
about the marvelous and altogether de- 
sirable change. She was no longer 
bored, How could she be with Elsie 
cutting a new tooth every few days 
and such wonderful hampers of clothes 
to be bought, fine handkerchief linen, 
narrow val and convent embroidery? 
A more fastidious customer had never 
entered the shops which specialize on 
layettes, and with her own bands Janet 
made covers for down pillows, silk 
tufted afghans and other foolish things, 
while the tongue of gossip wagyed 
gayly over the whole absurd episode. 

One frosty December afternoon Dal- 
ton ran down to the bungalow and 
found Janet standing at the window. 
The low spreading evergreens on the 
west side of the house were powdered 
lightly with snow, and Janet turned to 
him with kindling eyes, 

“Billy, I shall have a Christmas tree | 

for Elsie. She is so bright for her age. 
I do believe she will notice it.” 

“Quite likely,” responded Billy, with 
Assumed carelessness, as she laid aside 
his utorm coat, “but in making your 
plana you seem to have overlooked one 
important fact. As yet Elsie is not 
really yours. The law"— 

Janet turned on him sharply. 

“She is mine by right of—everything. 
1 found her, and I love her.” 

“Yes, but you must formally adopt 
her. 1 thought perhaps you'd better 
seo to that before I leave. I've changed 
my plans a bit. I'm going to meet 
mether and Grace in Rome for Christ- 
mas, Tho mater has not been feeling 
very fit. I am not fond of England in 
winter, and”— 

Janet crossed to bis side, and her 
hand rested lightly on bis arm, 

“Don't you think you'd enjoy much 
more seeing Elale bave ber first tree? 
And—and I think—I need you—more 
than your mother does.” 

Something rowe to Dalton’y throat 
and threatened to choke him, It was a 
sensation he had never felt before, not 
even during the good natured, lazy run 
of his wooing. Janet wanted him! He 
thought he had not cared. Now he 
knew that be bad cared all along. But 
it was characteristic be did not express 
hia flerce joy in words. He held Janet 
very close and whispered: 

“Well, I rather did hope you'd give 
the little beggar the name of Dalton. 
It's a pretty good name after all, eh?”

Not Too Abrupt, 

Radical changes in clothing are sel- 
dom safe, at least so the old time 
grandmothers held, The putting off of 
winter underwear was likely to be a 
gradual and prolonged process, That 
this bellef in deliberate adjustment 
was widespread and lnclusive is shown 
in W. P. Prith’s story of his life, He 
was engaged in painting a portrait of 
Mra. Birt, the wife of a prominent 
business man, who used to bring her 
little dog to share ber sittings, 

Mr. Birt was a great lover of dogs, 
but he entertained a strong aversion to 
dog collars, so | was surprised one day 
when Mrs, Birt brought her favorite 
dog, Ducky, to see a band around the 
little animal's neck, 

“I thought you objected to dog col- 
lara, Mrs, Birt," I sald, “1 see Ducky 
sports one today.” 

“Oh, no, that’s not a dog collar,” re 
turned the lady, “It's only a plece of 
flannel. The poor dear has had a 
dreadful cold and a sore throat, She 
has worn flannel night and day.” 

“Surely that ls too narrow to do any 
good, The strip ls no wider than a 
collar,” 

“Oh, it was wider, of.course, We 
have gradually lessened It, Bhe is 
leaving it off by degrees.”

Stole to Get Medical Ald. 

A poor man iu Vienna found It im- 
possible to gain admission to any of 
the public hospitals because they were 
all overcrowded. He stole a pair of

Leaves as Food, 

In England beech, willow and goose 
berry leaves have been used for sal- 
ads, and not so very long ago, when 
famine invaded northern Italy, the 
peasants kept themselves alive on 
dolled chestnut leaves, not the nuts, 
which are their toportant crop,

The Kindness of the Poor. 
The old adage that the poor are the 
est friends of the poor was instanced 
a the story of a chambermald, who ts 
» young widow with two children to 
upport, After a lingering sickness the 

|‘ounger of the children died, and, the 

‘oung mother’s bank account having 
een depleted from defraying the ex- 
enses of the weeks of medicine and 
joctor’s visits, she was obliged to con- 
tact a debt at the undertaker’s, After 
hat she paid a small monthly tnstall- 
hent until the bill was half settled, 
vhen one day there came through the 
nal] a receipt for the remainder. The 
ecelpt was accompanied by, a badly 
vritten and blotted note from a scrub- 
voman in a large uptown hotel, who 
tnew of the trouble, knew the family 
ind the circumstances and In her note 
ixplained that she had no family nor 
tear relatives and that she earned 
mough to support herself and that she 
wanted to use this surplus money for 
he little mother, who needed all that 
ihe could make extra to support the 
‘emaining child. As scrubwomen re- 
twelve only 50 or 75 cents a day, one 
will readily appreciate the spirit which 
noved one kind soul to help another 
n distress.—Leslie’s Weekly. 

What Words Can Do. 

“Any one who swears,” declared the 
‘shop of Carlisle, “manifests the beg- 
fartiness of his vocabulary.” The Con- 
tord Patriot puts it in this fashion: 

“People swear because they do not 
«mow the possibilities of plain Eng- 
ish or have not the skill to manipulate 
t so that it will yleld the amount of 
fre they want. You can do almost 
inything with common words, No 
natter how tame and lifeless they 
ook standing in stupid rows as if 
they didn't know enough to come in 
when It rained, they can be made to 
lance like Imps, to frolic like fairies, 
to float angelwise on light wings, to 
tlow like fire spirits, They can do 
ihings that make the ordinary bits of 
yrofanity look like feeble scarecrows 
itiffened up with a fence stake. The 
ture for profanity—reformers and edu- 
ators please make a note--is merely 
wit enough to handle your words #0 
that swearing will seem like baby talk 
n comparison.”

One of Blondin'’s favorite jokes was 
to offer to carry some distinguished

you are afraid I should drop you.” 
But he was holst once with his own 
petard. 

He was exhibiting in Paris and was 
about to cross the Selne on bis rope. 
Cham, the great caricaturist, had come 
to make asketch, Blondin, recognizing 
him, at once invited him to cross with 
bim. 

“With pleasure,” replied Cham, “but 
on one condition.” 

“And that is"— queried Blondin. 

“That I aball carry you on my back,” 
answered Cham, 

“Not if I know myself,” answered 
Blondin. 

“Ah,” triumphantly exclaimed Cham, 
“this time, M, Blondin, it Is you who 
are afraid!”

A FAMOUS VIKING. 

Late Captain Jackman of Newfound 
land Captured In His Time 
662,510 Seals. 

In the death, recently, of Captain 
Arthur Jackman, Newfoundland lest 
ite most famous Viking. 

For over forty years this mariner 
tavigated a ship to the ice-fields off 
the coast of Newfoundland in quest of 
als, Some of the adventures in 
which he was the hero are am 
the most thrilling incidents in m 

His name is a household word all 
over the island colony for his skill and 
jaring as @ mariner, and as probably 
she greatest and most successful cap- 
tain who ever steered a ship through 
the frozen ocean in search of seals, 

His know of the coast of New- 
‘oundland evoked universal admira- 
tion. He was able w find his wa 
through the most dense fogs and furi- 

& lempests with auasgii Cortainty; 
is record on the constal service being 
arked by scarcely on necident< This 

year, for the first time in over forty 
the famous old mariner will be miss- 
ing at the ice. He haa gone on his 
fat voyage; the ocean-eternity; the

His Sealing Career. 

Captain Jackman waa born in 1843 
at Renews, where the first of the 
Jackman family settled on coming to 
Newfoundland from Devonshire, near- 
Ay. centuries ago. Animated by 

spirit of daring and adventure 
characteristic of the race, he took to 
the sea as.a pursuit, and sailed as a 
lad with hia elder brother, the late 
Capt, Wm, Jackman. In 1865, at the 
age of 22, he was given command of a 
schooner at the seal-fishery, continu. 
ing to ee that industry until 
(871, w he made his last voyage 
in a sailer, the Fanny Bloomer. 

Appointed Master. 

Then he was appointed maater of 
the Hawk, in succession to his bro- 
ther, who had been promoted to the 

of the first steamer Eagle 
which had then been brought out a 
fnew ship from Scotland. During the 
ons 36 yoars he has had com- 
mand of the following sealing steam- 

5 Norwhal, 
lute springs), Eagle, los' 
ree aasore ‘iy & epri Ea 

ova ngs), present 
‘three springs 7 

). 
During these 36 he has 1 
into St. John’s, Nina. tani cals 
i per year, the 

During this period more than 6,000 
have been under his command, 
he has the record of never having 
loat one. In the worst blizzards that 
desolated the floes he always contriv- 
ed to pick up his crews, Some years 
however, deaths have occur: to 
some of his men th colds, or 
other diseases, but in 1807, the storm- 

leat spring in sealing annals, four of 
them died of diphtheria. That was 
the year he killed his trip off the Vir- 
gin ka, and was the oy, one of 
the fleet to load. He did the same 
again in 1905, and t was the sen- 
sation caused by his unex ap- 

nee after getting a trip away off 
the Banks ey, 

Arrived First. 

On March 21, 1878, he arrived first 
in the Paicon with 21,190; on March 
31, 1885, in the Resolute with 34,024; 
on March 27, 1896, in the Aurora 
with 20.916, and on March 24, 1906, 
in the FRagle with 32,064. He also en- 
joyed the reputation bringing in a 
saving trip every year. uring his 
career two ships were loat under him, 
the Hawk in 1876, and the Resolute 
in 1886, but the crows were saved 
each time. In 1886, when Dowring 
Bros. took the first coastal contract, 
with the Curlew and Plover, Capt, 
Jackman was appointed to the com- 
mand of the former ship on the west 
route and continued on that service 
for years. In 1889 he and his crew in 
the Plover narrowly escaped death 
while on a voyage from Sydney to St 
John's with a cai of coal, and their 
rescue was one the most thrilling 
incidents in marine annals, 

His Arctic Record. 

Besides his sealing voyages, Capt, 
Jackman waa the pioneer of the New- 
foundiand venture in the Greenland 
whaling industry, and went to the 
Arctic seas several years. Command- 
er Peary, the famous Arctic explorer, 
made his first trip there with Capt, 
Jackman in 1886, In 1893, while on a 
whaling voyage, the Eagle was lost, 
and the story of how Captain Jack- 
man brought his crew safely in open 
boats through hundreds of miles of 
joe-strewn sens, is equal to any in 
Aretic annals, and ts one of the moat 
stirring in marine history, 

When the “Discovery” South Polar 
expedition was frozen fast in Antaro- 
tie waters, and the Admiralty ht 
the sealer “Terra Nova" for a relief 
expedition, Commodore Montgomerie, 
of H. M. 8, Charybdis, who was en- 
trusted with get 

a ship and a 

commander, chose mn Jackman. 
Tn 1900 he went in the Kite to the 
relief of the American whaling station 
in Cumberland Sound, Baffin Land, 
after a sailing vessel bound there from 
Boston had been wrecked on Northern 
Labrador; and though it was very late 
in the season when he received or- 
ders to start, he carried out his mis- 
sion with eonspicuous success, His 
last great feat was the towing to 8t, 
ohn’s, in the trawler Magnific short- 
y before Christmas, 1904, of the 
schooner Bessie Dodd, cast away on 
Labrador, Dr, Grenfell lavished un- 
ttinted praise upon him for his splen- 
did work on that occasion. -

Snakes, 

Of all the creatures to be seen at 
sovlogical gardens snakes are probably 
the most easy to ship from one coun- 
try to another, Snakes take very little 
room and throughout a long voyage 
give not the least trouble, They do not 
require to be fed nor do they require 
looking after tn any other way, .

Several sponge farms, all of which 
are paying concerns, are to be found 
in the Mediterranean. Until recently 
sponges have been simply collected 
from the sea floor, where they have 
flourished In a wild state, but of late 
years they have, like oysters, been cul- 
tivated,

How He Got Even. 

During civil war times Gilman Fay, 
a local character known by all as 
Gil, being in need of groceries and 
household necessities, went to the gen- 
eral store in Fayville, kept at that 
time by Colonel Dexter Fay, to make 
his purchases. The amount was 68 
cents, and Mr, Fay tendered the clerk 
4 one dollar bill. Change being scarce 
in the store, as was often the case dur- 
ing these strenuous times, the clerk 
passed him some siips of paper with 
figures on them to equal the amount of 
change due. Gil looked at the slip, 
then at the clerk, and slowly said, 
“What's all this?’ “Why, that is what 
we are giving for change now. When 
you get one dollar's worth, we will re- 
deem then,” replied the clerk, and 
Gil went out. A day or two after 
this occurrence Gil went to the 
store again for some tobacco. The 
clerk passed out the plug, and Gil 
put his hand In bis pocket, pulled out 
a handful of pumpkin seeds and hand- 
ed them to the clerk, saying: “These 
fre what I am using for change pow. 
When you get a dollar's worth, | will 
redeem them.”—Boston Herald,

Stories of Brahms. 

Many stories are told of how the com 
poser Brahma treated pianists and 
singers who were eager to get bis criti- 
clam. Lf one of these aspirants for bis 
favor was fortunate enough to find bim 
at home and be received, Brahma’ first 
concern was to seat himself on the lid 
of bis plano, a position from which he 
rightly deemed few would have the te- 
merity to oust him. If this failed, be 
had recourse to the statement that the 
instrument was out of tune, “Oh, that 
does not matter,” remarked ove cour- 
Agoous lodividual, “Perhaps not to you, 
but it does to me,” replied the master, 
On one occasion be was just leaving 
bis house when « long baired youth, 
with a bundle of music under bis arm, 
halied him with, “Can you tell me 
where Dr, Brahms lives?” “Certainly,” 
answered the muster in the most amla- 
ble manner, “in this house, up three 
Oights.” And, #o saying, be burried 
away. 

The Treacherous Lioness. 

“Lionesses are far more dangerous 
than Hons,” sald an animal trainer. 
“Thelr tempers are more uncertain. 
They are wore treacherous, * They- are 
more wily. If a lion is in a bad hu- 
mor, he shows it. He growls and 
sparis aod lashes bis sides, You know 
what ts in the wind and prepare ac- 
cordingly. Buta licvess in a bad bu 
mor is as affectionate as a girl, She 
brushes, purring, against your leg, and 
she minds you with the Joyous alac- 
rity of a good fox terrier, Then, as 
soon a8 your back ts turned, whiz—a 
yellow streak shoots through the alr, 
and you are on your back, and she Is 
at your throat, With all the cat tribe 
it ia the same, Whenever you bear of 
@ trainer mauled or mangled, be sure 
it was a female, not a male, cat that 
did the deed.” N 

Greenland’s Glaciers. 

Nearly all the Greenland glaciers and 
tongues from the Internal ice cap ter- 
minate in vertical faces from 100 to 
1,000 feet high, presenting facilities for 
Investigation, The vertical faces reveal 
pronounced stratification on the basal 
ice, even earth materials in the bases 
carried by the ice being arranged to 
layers, Fine laminations were seen 
twelve or twenty to an inch, ‘The lay- 
ers are sometimes twisted and con- 
torted and even “shoved” over each 
other, The glacier movement at the 
fee border ts a foot per day to a foot 
per week,

“Talk about the instinct of the lower 
orders! I built a little two story house 
for our parrot not long ago, and the 
very next morning after I put her in it 
she looked out of the window and

“Why should she do that?” 

“Complaining «bout the house, 1

“But why should she swear at you?’ 

“Took me for the janitor, no doubt.”

Dehorning a Rhinoceros. 

A thinoceros which jived tn the Lon 
jfon zoo was troubled by Its horn, 
which grew down In front of its mouth, 
to that only with difficulty could it eat 
jw drink, To save its life the keeper 
lecided on amputation, The horn of a 
|dinoceros ig not a horn at all, but an 
tecumulation of hair and skin which 
tas hardened and become cemented to- 
fether by some gummy substance. The 
lywner of this one had a very touchy 
temper and was not easily approached. 
Its keeper, however, decided to try 
What be could do. For some days It re- 
‘quired all his skill to persuade the 
|beast to come to the front of the cage 
ind ptt Its horn through, Then for 
some days he stroked the horn, much to 
fhe animal's disgust at first, although 
later it seemed to like It. When it 
found he meant no harm it let him take 
the horn in his left band and then with 
the right imitate the motion of a saw 
tcross It. When this had been done 
tome time and the rhinoceros no longer 
ninded it, a plece of wood was beld in 
the right hand, and ot last, when even 
{this no longer worried the animal, a 
jteal saw was brought in and the horn 
}tut off without the slightest remon- 
ttrance from the owner of it.

A Terrible Punishment. 
A man suspected of treason In Mo- 
focco was punished by having the 

‘Gosh of his- hand sliced, the wound 

flied with salt and the whole hand 
tewed up tn leather, It’ ts a common 
belief that this punishment causes 
mortification to set In and that the 
band decomposes, but such ts not the 
tase, for by the time the leather wears 
bff the hand is healed, the result being 
that the band is rendered useless and 
temains closed forever. It is a puniah- 
Ment not often in use, but is some 
times done in cases of murder or con- 
ttant theft, as, without In any way in- 
juring the health of the man, it pre

ond time or for the hundredth time, 
as the case may be. It is a punish- 
ment that cannot be applied except by 
the sultan’s orders.—Blackwood's Mag- 

A Fairly Big Fish. 

Paddy had been telling the story of a 
big pike he caught, too big to get into 
the boat, so that be had to be towed 
behind (with the gaff in it, it must be 
understood), Then followed this dia- 
logue; “What weight, Paddy?’ “Div- 
vil a know I know, but he was an ojous 
baste.” “Was that the biggest you 
ever saw, Paddy?’ Then Paddy gave 
& description of the biggest he ever 
saw, “What weight, Paddy? “Sorra 
a bit I know, He was a terror.” 
“How big, Paddy?" “Sure, I can't tell 
to a foot or two, but a man could walk 
down his throat.” On this Incredulity, 
but Paddy “clinched the matter and 
silenced all controversy” by adding, 
“Wid bis hat on.”—Angler’s Evenings 

Emergency Foods. 

According to Dr, Robert Hutchinson 
of London, if at any time meat ls not 
available, bread, sugar and eggs will 
make “a very respectable support for 
the body.” Sugar le an exceedingly 
valuable article of food as a source of 
evergy, the unfortunate thing about It 
being that It contains no nltrogenous 
matter, Bread, however, does contain 
some; hence it balances up well when 
combined with sugar. In times of 
searcity of food bread and molasses ts 
hot a half bad diet—at least it can be 
relied on to keep the body up to a fair 
state of efficiency. 

Women as Walkers. 

Even the athletic girla and women 
of today ean hardly make any ad- 
Vance upon the record of Mary Lamb, 
who wrote to Miss Wordsworth (both 
women being between fifty and sixty 
years old): “You say you can walk 
fifteen miles with ease, That is ex- 
actly my stint.” She then speaks pity- 
ingly of a delicate woman who could 
accomplish “only four or five miles ev- 
ery third or fourth day, keeping very 
quiet between,”

Andrew Jackson’s Education. 

During each winter for two or three 
years after he had reached the age of 
seven Andrew Jackson was sent to the 
old field school of a Mr, Branch. After 
this he attended the select school which 
& Presbyterian preacher, the Rey. Dr. 
David Humphreys, taught in the Wax- 
haw settlement. He appears to have 

the Carolinas. At some later period of 
his youth he is said to have attended 
the old Queen college or seminary at 
Charlotte a couple of terms, but the 

sandpaper. Ina few minutes the baby 
began to cry with a reliable yelp that 
could be heard above the din o* the 

“I think we had better sit over bere, 
Jim.” 

This ungallant act plainly embar- 
tassed the little mother, but she was 
equal to the occasion. 

“It won't do a bit of good to change

A Dying Glass. 

In the glass collection at the Museum 
of Art In Dresden, Germany, there Is a 
large drinking cup which stands apart 
from all other art objects under a 
heavy glass cover. It ts of Dutch 
workmanship, and the Inscriptions and 
style show that It was made early tn 
the eighteenth century. The vessel is 
remarkable because it ls known tn the 
tmuveum, says a Berlin paper, “as bav- 
ing consumption which can be com- 
tmunicated to other objects of glass. 
On that account It Is Isolated. There 
tre remedies against this glans disease, 
which ts usually developed because of 
defects in the glass mixture, but these 
have not been applied to the Dutch 
veasel In order that the progress of the 
wasting disease may be observed.” 

A Big Calculation In Water. 

The ocean, sea and lake surface of 
our planet Is estimated at something 
like 145,000,000 square miles, with an 
average depth of 12,000 feet, and ts 
ealenlated to contain not less than 
6,270,000,000,000,000 tons of water. 
The rivers of the earth are estimated 
to have a flow sufficient to cover thir- 
ty-six cuble miles of the above area 
tach day. Now, if all the oceans were 
suddenly dried and the rivers 
keep up thelr present rate of 
which, of course, they could not with- 
out ocean evaporation, !t would 
8,500 years to refill the basin.

It is well known, says 
that certain kinds of fishes are able 
Mve out of water much longer tha

upon the length of time that their gille

One of the best known of the ria 
ing young men of western journaliem 
is the subject of this sketch, As a 
journalist and printer of experience 
he has a reeord that few can equal 
He has his own excellence as printer 
and editor to thank for bis present 
position 

Mr. Laurie was born at Barrie, On 
tario, about thifty years ago, the son 
of Alagander Laurie, late of Hadding: 
ton, Metland, and Frances D. Drury 

of Barrie, Ont. His first school years 
were spent at Barrie, and the balance 
of his education was acquired in To 
ronto. Though he left school at the 
age of fourteen and spent a couple 
of years with the. crockery firm of 
Gowans, Kent & Co., he still applied 
himeaelf to night studies and pushed 
forward in thie way, Being strongly 
inclined to journaliam in a practical 
way, he wisely set himself the task 
of learning the art of printing, that 
it might be of benefit to him when 
he should reach the higher branches 
of the business 

Alter serving his apprenticesttip 
with the well nous printing firm oi 
Jas. Murray Co.,he came west aa fat 
as Rat Portage In the mining boom 
days, and obtained employment with 
the News, under the late BE. A. Chap 
man, as reporter and business man

r. F. A. Demorest, then publisher 

the Keewatin Enterprise. After 
is he was for three years edito 
the Fort Francis Times and one 
r with the Virden Advance, With 
these Mr, Laurie wae occupying a 
salaried position, but in November, 

1906, the opportunity of getting inte 

the business for himselt’ occurred, 

and in company with Me. John W. 

Young, late of the Chatham Planet, 

acquired the Prince Albert Times

t Abounds In Graft That Would Not

If there is any man on this earth, 
white or black, who fasists that his 
etpenses in competitive sport must be 
ho drain on himself, that man is the 
Britisher, And he is quite right. Au 
amateur should be neither In nor out a 
dollar, It is entirely proper that his 
club, bis college, bis association or such 
collection of bodies as he represents 
should pay bis legitimate expenses 
when he is sent to compete for that 
college of club or association or union, 
England goes much farther and gives 
much more latitade in the matter of 
expenses than we do, fn cricket, for 
example, “amateur” players in Engtand 
Whose services are desired for the 
county champlonship series are liter-

The extreme callousness of the old 
English gamblers, or geutlewen, as 
they were then called, ls iliustrated by 
the following account which Horace 
Walpole, the celebrated letter writer, 
gives of a curious occurrence at 
White's coffee house tn London. In 
one of bis episties to Bir Horace Mann, 
under date of Bept. 1, 1700, he says: 
“They have put lute the papers a good 
story, made at White's, A man dropped 
down dead at the door and was carried 
In, The club immediately made bets 
whether he was dead or not, and whea 
they were going to bleed him the wa- 
gerers for bis death tuterposed and 
sald it would affect the falrness of the 
bet, and they stopped their efforts.” 

What Serprised Him, 

The minister of a certain church was 
greatly exercised by the droway babite 
of his people. Taking them to task on 
this score on Sunday afternoon, he re- 
marked: “I see a great many of you 
overcome with sleep, 1 do not wonder 
at it, for the weather le oppressive, 
your work Is hard and many of you 
have come a long way, Therefore,” 
he added, “I am not surprised to see 
many of you asleep, but what surprises 
me is to see many sleeping who bave 
had such a comfortable sleep here ta

EXPRESS ORDERS 
FOR SENDING MONEY 

Used Extensively by Chinese—Little 
Goes to England; but Consid- 
erable Comes This Way. 

Originally the only means of send 
ing a remittance in the form of an 
order payable on demand was through 
the post office, but, owing to the fact 
that these orders cannot be cashed 
at all offices, the wee of the express 
money order has become common 

At one time the express companies 
were satisfied to carry the actua 
cash from one person to another; thir 
involved much risk, extra labor, and 
consequently higher rates, Gradual 
ve however, it dawned upon then 
that it would be safer, cheaper, anc 
more convenient for everybody con 
cerned, if, instead of requiring the re 
mitter to put hie money into an en 
velope ant weal it, the agent woul 
take the money and give the remit 
teran order on theexpress agent at) 
destination, to pay the money to the 
payee out of funds which had accum 
ulated in like manner at the destin | 
ation office. The same object way | 
attained; the money was transmit 
ted from the remitter to the pe 
but under conditions whieh were | 
much more satisfactory to the cur | 
tomer and to the express company 
Starting thus in a small way, the 
convenience of the plan soon realized. | 
aud the business inecreaseds and, ae 
it increased, improvements in the 
methods of handling it were tnade 
from time to time, decreasing — the 
cost and increasing the effectiveness 
till now the express money order 
aystent has become one of the-great 
eat public conveniences ever devi» 
ed, and today there is no other aye 
tem for tranemitting money that 
gives more satisfactory service to 
many people, and at euch small cost 

The express companies claim that 
by reason of their large number o | 

agencies throughout Canada, and b 
thei: connections with the expres 
companies of the United States, they | 
are able to give the public a service | 
that no other institution, not ever | 
the government iteelf, has been ably 
to give. The express companies ar: 
represented at every railroad statior 
in Canada and the United States—al 
hundreds of places where t ar | 
no banks, nor even post offices, an 
they thus serve thousands of peop! 
who otherwise would not be server | 
a’ all, In the larger towne and citie | 
she expresa companies have appoint | 
ed druggists and storekeepers wanes | 
agenta in convenient localities, both 
in the business and residental dir: | 
tricta, where the public may be ser | 
ved at all hours of the day; where 
one mA buy a money order or get 
one ananed at times when it would! 
be impossible to get accommodation | 
anywhere else he convenience to} 
the public in purchasing and cashing 
money orders is not the only benefit | 
derived from the express companies’ | 
ayatem 

One feature that appeals to thowe | 
who have had the experience in the 
facility with which a refund may be 
obtained when an express order I) | 
lost. Application for refund may be 
made through any express agent in| 
Canada and the United Btates, The! 
applications are dealt with promptly, | 
and refund will be made to the pe} 
mitter or the amount paid to the) 
payee, without extra charge, at any | 
express office, Thus, if an order i 
inaued in Toronto, and ia lost by the! 
remitter, or goes astray in the mails} 
(or falla into the wrong persons 
hands) the remitter may apply for a 
refund at Toronto, or, Uf he be in} 
some other part of the country, he} 
say apply to an express agent wher) 
ever he is, and it will be arranged 
and, if he is traveling, the amount! 
may be paid to him through an ex-| 
preaxs agent at still another part of] 
the country, or, if he prefers, pay-) 
ment will be made to the original 
payee, wherever he may be 

} 
Curiously enough, the Chinese are 
ae & clans, the greatest remitters of | 
money by this means, The statement} 
wa, made by a prominent official of 
the Dominion Express Company that) 
he did not believe there was a single! 
Chinese in the country who did not 
remit more or leas regularly through 
this channel, "Wherever we have an} 
agent and a chink settler in the same 
town our inetructions are to cultivate | 
him, for we know that, sooner or 
Jater, he will be sending money,” 
said he, “From Canada alone the 
Chinese remit at least $500,000, (Chine 
ese silver dollars) every month It)

Canadian, 
who, in order to put his ideals into 
effect, was the candidate in two ele 
tions, one provincial in Ontario am 
one federal in Manitoba, in both oi 
which he was defeated; in one in 
jstance in a riding notoriously cor- 
rupt and susceptible to the use of 
money and in the other in a city 
more anxious to secure the tempor 
material advantages of the 
Grand Trunk Pacific than to be re 
presented in parliament by a man 
| who had not sucked the dregs of 
besotted = peartidanship We 
lish today a part of the speech de- 
livered by Mr 
banquet of the club delivered in 
1805, shortly after ite formation. 
“IT eam proud to respond to the 
}toast, for this club is the embodi 
ment of the spirit of Canadian 
itionality, and I am not ashamed of 
my country. We have within our 
selves all the elements of a 
nation. We recognize this fact in 
tellectually; but do we appreciate it 
fully ? We have a national senti 
ment and there are forces now at 
work which are differentiating us 
from other peoples. We even now 
difer from the people from the lands

the differences are growing; afd so

Nhnost illimitable opportunitios 
for development are opened before 
this club The fact of Canadian na 

lionality bas had scant recognition 
in the past; but the fact of the

‘THE APPEAL TO THE

If the members of the Imperial

court of appeal The colonies had

bar, of ite own, In cases affecting 
imperial jnteresta or law suite bet- 
ween citizens of different colonies it 
inmay still be necessary to have an

blackness of the strange chamber was) 

broken ever and anon by falnt dashes 
of light from without, and she lived 
through long minutes of terror before 
it dawned upon her that a thunder 
storm was brewing. The wind was 
rising, and the night seemed agog with 
excitement Beverly crept from her 
ouch and felt her way to the fluttering 
doorway. Drawing aside the bianket, 
she peered forth into the night, her 
heart Jumping with terror, Her high- 
ness Was very much afraid of thunder 
and lightning. 

The fire in the open had died down 
until naught remained but a few glow 
ing embers. These were blown into 
brilllancy by the wind, casting a steady 
red light over the acene, There was 
but one human figure in sight. Beside 
the fire stood the tall wanderer, He 
was hatiess and coatioss, and bis arme 
were folded across his chest, Seeming- 
ly oblivions to the approach ef the 
storm be stood staring into the heap of 
ashes at bie feet. His face was toward 
her, every feature plainly distingulsh- 
able in the faint glow from the fre. To 
her amazement the black patch was 
missing from his eye, and, what sur- 
prised her almost to the point of ex- 
claiming aloud, there appeared to be 
absolutely no reason for its presence 
there at any time, There was no mark 
or blemish upon or about the eye. It 
was as clear and penetrating as its 
fellow, darkly gleaming in the red glow 
from below, Moreover, Beverly saw 
that he was strikingly handsome—a 
strong, manly face, The highly im- 
oginative southern girl's mind reverted 
to the Oret portraits of Napoleon she 
had seen, 

Suddenly be started, threw up bis 
bead and, looking up to the aky, utter. 
ed some strange words, Then he strode 
abruptly toward her doorway, She 
fell back breathless, He stopped just 
outside, and she knew that he was 
listenlug for sounds from withia. Aft 
er many winutes she stealthily looked 
forth again, Le was standing near the 
fire, bis back toward ber, looking off 
luto the night 

The wind was growing stronger, The 
breezes fanned the night Into a rush of 
shivery cooluess, Constant Miekerings 
of lightning Uluminated the forest, 
transforming the treetops into great 
black waves, Tall reeds along the riv 
er bauk began to bend thelr tops, to 
ewlog themeelves gently to and from 
the wind, In the lowlands dowa from 
the Willo’ the wiepa played tag 
with Jack-o'-lanterns, merrily scamper 
tng about in the blackness, remind 
jog ber of the revelers ln a famous 
Brocken scene, Low moans grew out 
of the hbavoe, and volces seemed to 
speak lo vulotelligible whispers to the 
fgitated twigs and leaves, The se 
creta of the wind were belong spread 
upon the records of the night. Tales 
ef many climes passed through the 
eara of Nature. 

Yrom gentile undulations the marsh 
land reeds swept into lower dips, 
danced wilder wiauets, lashed each 
ether with infatuated glee, mocking 
the whistle of the wind with au angry 
wish of their tall bodies, Around the 
cornices of the Ino of the Hawk and 
Haven scurried the singing breezes, re 
luctant to leave a playground #0 pleas

the sovereignty of the wind; clouds 
roared with the rumble of a million

earth met to one of those savage con-

she saw bim throw his arms aloft as’

She did not have to look down to know

“Goodness!” gasped Beverly, and 
then it was pitch dark again, The man 
at ber side called out a command in his 
own language and then turned bis face 
close to hera, 

“Do not be alarmed, We are quite

quite at bome to the tempest. There 
are other things mieh more annoying, 
I assure your highness, We shall have 
lights in a moment.” Even as he spoke 
two or three lanterns began to flicker 
feebly 

“Be quiet, Aunt Fanny, you are not 
killed at all,” commanded Beverly 
quite firmly. 

“De house is suah to blow down, 
Mins—yo" highness,” gronned the trusty 
maldservant, Beverly laughed bravely 
but nervously with the tall goat hunter, 
le at once set about making bis guest 
comfortable and secure from the ef 
fects of the tewpest, which was now at 
lie height. Her couch of cushions was 
dragged far back into the cavern and 
the rescued blankets, though drenched, 
again became a screen, 

“Do you imagine that I'm going to 
there while this storm rages?” Beverly 
demanded as the work progressed, 

“Are you not afraid of lightning? 
Most young women are.” 

“Thats the trouble, | am afraid of

CUBAL! OHE SHIPMENTS, 

For Last Nine Months Records Show 
$1,000,000 Exported. 

The details of shipments forming 
the output of the silver-cobalt mines 
of the Cobalt region have just been ts 
sued by the bureau of mines for the 
nine monthe —_ Sept 30 last. 

The cobalt, nickel and arsenic con- 
tents of the shipments are to some ex- 
tent estimated, since the purchasers of 
ore in most casesgoay nothing for these | 
Constituents, and no assays for them 
are made, 

The facet remains, however, that for 
the nine months there has been ship. 
ped 2,542,897 ounces of silver, worth 
$1,400,654, and in October 1,199 tons 
additional ore haa been shipped, 

| Averaging the price of this 1,120 tona 

at the same rate aa for the 2,906 tons | 
shipped in the preceding nine months 
it would come to close on $800,000, or, 
say, @ total of $2,400,000 in round fig 
ures for the ten months of 1906

Guelph's Success. 

Guelph hae joined the list of cities 
which are handling successfully their 
municipal utilities. Three years ago 
the local atreet railway waa on the 
market, then an unprofitable concern, 
but believed to have a future The | 
citizens voted to purchase it, not with 
the expectation that it would soon 
pay, but with the view of regaining 
control of their streets and of the en- 
trances to the city by radial railways 
Yet Ald. Ryan, treasurer of the Street 
Railway Commission has turned over 
to the City Council a cheque for $4,400, 
which representa 4 1-2 per cent. upon 
the money invested by the eity, All 
charges have been paid and $5,900 
spent during the year in maintenance 
and improvement of the roadbed and 
rolling stock, both of which are in bet 
ter condition than ever before

PROTECTIVE RESEMBLANCE. 

Mimicry of Color and Form Common 
Among Insects. 

An official of the National museum 
at Washington who has made many 
trips abroad in the interest of that in- 
stitution states that in South Ameri- 
can forests the butterflies and the birds 
are equally brilliant in their colors, but 
that the butterfiles, being weaker, fall 
a prey to the birds, One very bright 
hued species of butterfly, however, ts 
not disturbed by the birds on account 
of the disagreeable odor that it enilts, 
Singulerly enough, some other groups 
of butterflies, which resemble in color 
the species just described, also escape 
persecution by the birds, although they 
emit no odor, It is evident that the 
similarity of colur deceives the birds, 
and thus serves asa shield for the but- 
terfiies. This sort of mimiery of color 
and form, which naturalists eall “pro 
tective resemblance,” i¢ mot very wn- 
common among insects, 

Auother form Of “protective resem- 
blauce” which exhibits much contriv- 
ance and skill is sometimes found 
among birds. Some birds hide their 
exgs among stones that resemble the 
eges in form and color, The little “bot- 
tle tit’ In England weaves a bottle 
shaped pest ont of moss, Helehs and 
spiders’ webs, and when placed tn a 
tree or bush the nest so closely fesem- 
bles sts surroundings that it can bard 
be detected. The color and appeara 
of the nest are imitations of the pre- 
valling color and appearance of the 
particular tree in which it is placed,

The Closed | 
Gentian 

By Virginia Leila Wents 

t, 1008, by M. M. Cunningham |} 

The serious business of settling up 
her brother’s estate was about finish- 
ed, Miss Morton leaned weartly back 
in her invalid’s chair and sighed, Aft- 
er all, she was sorry. Doubtless it 
would mean a cessation of her law- 
yer’s frequent and pericdic visits, 
And—well, he had been something 
under her sun, 

“L leave for Bat Harbor tomorrow, 
to be gone a week. On my return I'll 
send you a telegram and arrange for 
our final interview.” Howell Or 
chard's crisp, staccata sentences pune. 
tured her reverie. He was picking up 
his gloves. A high cart had just driv- 
en under the porte-cochere, and Miss 
Morton’s liveried groom was busy 
quieting the antics of a pair of brown 
cobs, 

Miss Morton groped for a pretext to 
spin out the call of her lawyer—if only 
for five minutes, It was stupid of Pe- 
ter to have driven up so early--and so 
bourgeois! Her eye fell on the near 
est object—a bow! of orcuids, 

“Exquisite, are they not?” she said, 
with a slight indicating motion of her 
patrician, blue veined hand, Orchard's 
keen glance noted them, at the same 
time ranging the extravagant refine 

ment of the room. 

“In keeping with their surroundings, 
Miss Morton,” be rejoined, pulling on 
his left hand glove, “Artistically cor- 
rect.” 

She made no further pretext. It was 
‘atnous, but It answered her purpose. 
‘What is your favorite flower?’ - she 
asked. 

It was an inane question, and she bit 
her lip, But, to ber relieved surprise, 

Orchard gave her inquiry his consider 
ation. 

“The closed gentian,” he said after a 
slight pause, 

e s 6 e e eo ° 

Wynchell, Miss Morton’s country 
home, with its ancestral acres, was 

about far enough from Jorsey City te 
leave time on the suburban train for a 
comfortable perusal of tho paper and a 
yawn or two bealdes, : 

Orchard spread out his sheet 
feally, But even the stock market news 
didn’t seem to interest him, and he 
looked far beyond bis paper, That was 
only natural. He was looking back 
through several seasons of blossoms 
and snow, this man, who, young as he 
was, had already begun to be called 
@ woman hater. The whizzing tele- 
graph wires and poles passed unseen. 
The noise of the engine, the rumble of 
the wheels, dwindled Into silence, In 
thelr stead came the low, exquisite 
voice of a girl: 

“It’s such a beautiful little flower In- 
side, Howell”— 

The day had been full of late Bep- 
tember elixir, then as now. The tread 
of loveliness had been on the fleids of 
g@rase and fodder ripened by August 
suns and tanned by early frosts to an 
autumnal bronze, Somewhere from 
among the hedges of sumac had come 
the call of a quail, Then presently the 
girl had stopped near a silvery stream 
and plucked a plain enough looking 
dark blue flower and pinned it on his 
coat, 

“It's a closed gentian, you know, 
dear,” sho bad explained, while the 
soft tendrils of ber balr had uncon- 
aclously brushed his strong chin. “You 
nee,” sho went on, stooping to pluck an- 
other, “they're not so very handsome 
outside, but Inside—look!” Delicately 
as a spring sephyr abe bad pricked the 
portala open, “lt puts the flaming 
goldenrod and al) the staring purple 
daisies here to shame, doesn't It?" Bhe 
lifted her face to him-—the face of a 
girl not particularly beautiful, but glo- 
rifled by a dazzling smile, 

He had left her at the gate of her 
little western home and, leaning over 
the rustic fence in the privacy of tlie 
broad oak, bad bid her goodby, for he 
was going to the big eastern metropo- 
lia for a year or two to win fame and 
fortune for them both, He went away 
with the sweetness of her kiss upon bis 
lips, her tear upon his cheek, her fow- 
er ta his coat. 

Later there had come a misunder- 
standing, of the alight, Insignificant 
sort that most young lovers have; but, 
alas, in this case before the gentle, 
healing wind of the real truth had 
blown tragedy had visited the girl's 
home, and when the man sought ber 
abe was not to be found, Out in ber 
little western village people told a 
tale of her father’s long illness and 
death—how she had nursed him night 
and day with untiring tenderness; how, 
their slight income being exhausted, 
she bad taken up water color work 
and filled orders for dinner cards and 
little pictures; how finally, upon his 
death, she had gone to New York city 
to earn-her living in such fashion as 
she could. 

That was all Orchard had been able 
to Jearn, and that had been two years 
ago. To find a girl who does water 
color work on dinner cards In New 
York city 1s not an easy matter, By 
the time his train had reached the 
smoke of the tunnel the man with the 
unread paper was thoroughly out of 
conceit with one Emily; by the time 
the ferryboat bad bumped Into the 
slip on the New York side he was 
thoroughly out of conceit with bim- 
wolf,

Miss Morton brought her lorgnon te

fst brent in, 

© » »t vou call close? 
gentians?’ questioned she half tncred- 
ulously. “Are you sure?” 

“I-I’'m very sure, Miss Morton.” 
The girl's voice, was exquisitely low 
and musical, 

“But they're so homely, so unfinished 
looking, and I thought—well, never 
mind, Arrange them there in that 
vase, if you will, My lawyer, a young 
fellow in whom I've taken a great in- 
terest, is coming up to Wynchell to- 
day, and they are his favorite flower.” 

Miss Gray lost the last of the sen- 
tence, From the silver faucet in Miss 
Morton's marble bathtub she was 
@awing water for tbe cut elaas she 

held. Besides, Miss Morton had spo- 
ken more than half to herself, 

It had been only three days now taat 
Miss Gray had been with her in the 
capacity of companion, and already 
Miss Morton found herself exchanging 
that young person's status from com- 
panion to confidante. She had always 
had a liking for her, this girl with the 
tired, pale face and the sweet, sudden 
smile, ever since the day when she 
had come personally to explain that 
there had been some little mistake In 
the ordered dinner cards and to make 
her apologies, It appears she had giv- 
en the dinner ladies powdered silver 
hair instead of dazzling gold, That 
had been at the beginning of last sen- 
son. During the present summer the 
little sketches that she had been able 
to sell hadn’t proved sufficient for her 
to eke out even a modest existence 
with. Miss Morton was looking for a 
companion, and she had offered her 
services. That is the way it had all 
come about. 

There was the rhythmic thud-thud of 
horses’ hoofs on macadam, and Miss 
Morton's brown cobs whirled through 
fn fron gate Into a modest drive and 
came to an abrupt halt under her 
porte-cochere. A gray drizzle had set 
in, but what did that matter to How- 
ard Orchard? The fine drops of rain 
driven against his face by the pace of 
the cobs had been an exhilarating de- 
light to him, and as Miss Morton was 
wheeled into the library to greet him 
he was positively cordial, 

Miss Morton had forgotten her tor- 
gnon, Being very shortsighted, she was 
at a loss to know exactly where her 
companion had placed the gentians. 
And, above all things, should the sight 
of the flowers bring an appreciable 
fraction of pleasure into Orchard’s im- 
mobile face she didn't want to lose the 
sight. She rang for a maid. 

“Ask Miss Gray to fetch me my 
lorgnon,”' said she. 

“So you remembered!* The exclama- 
tion came from Orchard, and Miss Mor- 
ton lost the sight she had wished for, 
after all. He had crossed to an ebony 
cabinet on top of whic stood the cut 
gines vase, “Awkward things to ar- 
range In vases, though,” he commented 
laconically, as if regretting bis burst of 
emotion. 

“Yes, that's what my compaiton said, 

But Orchard veered quickly around, 
In the mirror back of the ebony cabt- 
net he'd caught the reflection of a girl's 
face. Before he had seen her face, 
though, he had recognized ber. There 
was no other woman be knew who 
held her head so proudly and at the 
same time bad that wavering little 
walk so at variance with the queenly 
carriage of ber head, 

“Emily!” he cried. “Yout" 

The girl's hand which held the lor- 
gnon clutched it tightly and went up to 
her breast. The other balf groped to 
ward him, as with a little incredulous 
ery she repeated the one word, “You!" 

@ e e ® eo e @ 

“Too bad, too bad,” murmured kind 
hearted Miss Morton indulgently to 
herself that evening, laying down her 
Goethe unread, The day had cleared 
beautifully, The last scrap of estate 
settling business had been attended to, 
and now her lawyer and her com- 
panion were enjoying a bit of the mel- 
low harvest moon out on the back 
veranda, “Too bad! I was just begin- 
ning to congratulate myself on what a 
treasure Miss Gray would be in my de 
elining years, and now—the end of the 
beginning or the beginning of the end. 
Marie,” she said, turning to the maid, 
“take those homely blue flowers away, 
Take them up to Miss Gray's room.”

house of the latter, the former has to 
catch hold of a fish in a certain wel- 
come ceremony, in prospect, perhaps, 
of a generation os fruitful as that of a 
fish, While entering a new house for 
the first time the lady ts to take hold 
of a fish, probably for the same rea- 
son, Whatever may be the reason for 
regarding the handling of fish as auspl- 
clous, it Is indisputable that over a 
large part of northern India the “wa- 
ter vegetable (as it is called by high 
caste Punjabis, who eat it in spite of 
its being considered forbidden food for 
Brahman, Khatris and Baniyas) ts 
taken to assure good luck, The writer 
of this was hastening to Nepal to see 
a sister who was dangerously ill, He 
came across a Nepalese gentleman near 
Patna, who offered to accompany him 
to his destination, being moved to pity 
on hearing of his errand. When croas- 
ing the Ganges from Digha Ghat to 
Paleza Ghat a big hilsa fish fell at bis 
feet on the deck of the steamer as if 
hurled by an unseen hand, Perbaps 
it had been atruck by the stern wheel 
and thrown up over the bulwark, The 
Nepalese friend jumped up in great 
excitement, exclaiming; Milere is a 
sign from heaven-the happlest omen 
for you, my lad, You will find your 
deter out of danger.” All classes in 
Nepal share the superstition of the 
Sengalls in regard to fish,—Lahore

To tron Sheets, 

One of the greatest “time savers” on 
froning day is the knowledge of how 
to fold a abect, and I Gnd that very 
few people know how to do this, even 
though it seems so simple, Bo many 
women trou one side of the sheet, then 
refold and tron the other, Minutes 
are money oftentimes and especially 
when a basket is well rounded with 
ualroned clothes. Instead of foldirg 
the sheet In the old fashioned way, 
bring the upper and lower hems to- 
gether, then fold from right to left, 
having the upper bem of the sheet on 
the outside, In this way the whole up. 
per half of the shect 's lroned without 
refolding, and really that ts all that ts 
necessary, for when the sheet ironed tn 
this way Is on the bed one cannot dia 
tingulsh that the lower balf baan't been 
smoothed, 

Try this and see what a really prac 
tical idea it Is, 

GIRL CLIMBS STEEPLE. 

In the Teeth of a Terrific Gale Goes 
Up a Church Spire. 

An English girl 17 years old has ac 
complished the extraordinary feat of 
ascending a church spire 260 feet high 
in the teeth of a gale o® wind. 

Mr. Larkins, the steeplejack, of Bow 
had undertaken to ascend the spire of 
All Saints’, Hereford, the highest in 
the West of England and Miss Elsie 
Heins, the daughter of one of the 

churehwardens, volunteered to ac- 
company him. 
The ascent was made by means of 

4 steeplejack's cradle, In spite of the 
foree of the wind and of the swaying 
of the cradle, the girl, Mr. Larkins 
says, was remarkably all through 
the perilous ascent and desrent. Need- 
less to say, the spire had never been 
ascended before any except male 
climbers. 

A great crowd watched in thrilling 
cuspeneg the ascent of the Byezing 
cradle. Traffic was entirely blocked b 
the crowd, every member of which 
ttood stockstill until the fi had 
gained the summit, descen: again

ANTIQUE JEWELRY. 

Society Women Revert to Fashions 
of Thetr Grandmothers, 

A revival of the old fashioned jew- 
elry beloved of our grandmothers is 
worn this winter. 

The chief characteristic of this jew- 
elry is its enormous size. Great cameo 
brooches, medallions of Leeds pottery 
set In gold rims and worn as pend- 
ants and massive amethyst, jet or to- 
paz ornaments are being unearthed 
from old jewel cases or hunted for in 
secondhand shops. 

“This fashion is not likely to become 
@ wxiversal one,” a well known art 
Gealer said recently, “for the simple 
reason that the supply cannot meet 
the demand. 

“To copy old cameos with any suc- 
cess is an almost impossible task, and 
in any case people object to copies. 1 
have a priceless black Leeds medal 
lion at present which will be convert 
ed Into a pendant. Its fortunate wear. 
er cannot be imitated, as there Is not 
such another plece @n existence. 

“A prettier fashion is the delicate 
Wedgwood jewelry, carried out in its 
typical pastel tints, which tone 40 well 
with the dresses of today. These also 
tre too rare ever to become common. 

“Old necklaces are also fashionable, 
and many ladies appear this season 
Wearing the old fashioned sets of six- 
ty years ago. These consist of a mase- 
Ive necklace, brooch and long droop- 
fag earrings.”

Making Baby's Mair Curly. 

Young mothers may be glad to know 
that a baby's halr may often bo em 
couraged to curl naturally if it iq 
brushed upward and twisted round 
the finger while it is wet. Brushing 
downward rather encourages a child's 
hair tc grow straight. The upward 
brushiug ts not becoming for the time, 
and tl44 is no doubt the reason that so 
few cure to persevere with the idea; 
bot it well repays one afterward. Of 
course it is not every head of hatr 
that responds to the treatment, but ia 
many cases it has been successful, 

Boft soap is a very good thing with 
which to wash the children’s hair, but 
remember it froths a great deal and 
very little will suffice. If you use too 
moch you will find a difficulty in rins- 
ing It out thoroughly, 

Vor Cleaning Kid Gloves. 

This recipe may be applied to the

Put the gloves on the hand and then

moisten it very alightly with sweet 
milk, 

Rub on gently a little plece of castile 
soap and carefully go over the soiled 
gloves until clean, Then rub with dry 
flannel! cloth,

ed. If she happen to be a shopman’s 
wife, he needs no bookkeeper or man-

careful of ont centime, while he, 
too, often will leave the heavier part 
of the business in her capable hands

A London Banquet of 1582, 

A Spanish visitor to London In 1582 
leseribes a banquet of that day. “1 will 
ell you no lye,” he begins cautiously. 
I saw such kindes of meate eaten as 
we wont to be sene and not eaten—as 
| horse rosted, a cat In gely, little liz 
ts with whot broth, frogges fried and 
livers other sortes of meates, which | 
mwe theme eate, but I never knew 
what they were till they were eaten.” 
The “quaking custard” of that pertod 
was a huge dish in the middle of the 
able, Into which, “at a private signal, 
he city fool suddenly leaped over the 
veads of the astonished feasters, who 
were instantly bespattered with this 
Ach and savory mud.” Undeterred, 
rowever, by this nasty behavior, the 
Mtizens not only ate plentifully of the 
sustard, but even took some home to 
their wives. Nor were the women of 
those days backward In demanding ex- 
pensive datuties for themselves, it 
seems, for an essayist of 1001 sarcastic. 
ally asks: “Who will not admire our 
tice dames of London, who must have 
cherries at 20 shillings a pound and 
peascods at 6 shillings a peck? Yuag 
rabbettes of a spanne and chickens of 
an inch?” 

Slaves In Scotland. 

Were there once slaves in Scotland? 
A volume on Scottish Industrial and 
social history in the eighteenth and 
alneteenth centuries bas some passages 
on the subject: 

“It shocks us very much to learn 
that the men, and even the women, 
who worked In the coal mines at that 
time—1, ¢, the eighteenth centary—in 
Beotland still continued to be, as of 
old, little better than siaves. Dy a 
law passed by the Scottien parliament 
in 1000 every man who once went to 
work in a coal mine was bound to la- 
bor in it all bis life as a “necessary 
servant.” If he tried to ran away he 
was tried and punished as a thief, If 
the land was sold on which the coal 
pit stood In which he worked be was 
sold with it like any of the machinery 
of the pit. In 1775 an act of pariia- 
ment was passed which set free most 
of the pit workers, but it was not till 
the end of the century that this form 
of slavery was quite abolished.” 

044 Occerrence In the Hunting Field 

On the afternoon of Feb, 8, 1704, the 
hounds of his grace ihe Duke of Beau- 
fort were In full ery. The run bad been 
a long one, and they kuew that the fox 
wae almost spent. Suddenly the scent 
turned abruptly from the open, leading 
straight into the garden of a cottage In 
the little village of Castle Coombe. 
Those who were following wondered 
what had happened and were more as- 
tonished still to see the entire pack, 
without checking for an Instant, dash 
through the open door Into the little 
room, A sbrill scream was beard, and 
when the whipper in threw himself 
from his horse and gained the thresh- 
old he saw a sight which probably no 
fox hunter has ever met before or 
since. A white faced woman stood 
Clasping @ child tn her arma,and right 
there In the cradle, from which the In- 
fant bad jost been snatched, eighteen 
couple of flerce hounds wore struggling

The Auto Mabit. 

Bome deliver has found In the Bible 
what he believes to be a hint of auto 
mobiles, It is contained in the story 
of the vision of Nahum, the Elkoahite, 
concerning the burden of Nineveh, Ip 
the account given by this seer of the 
military array of the Medes and Baby- 
lonians against Nineveh occurs this 
verse; “The chariots shall rage in the 
streets, they shall jostle one against 
the other In the broad way, they shall 
seem like torches, they shall run like 
the lightning.” If that doegm’t de 
scribe a street full of motor cars what 
does? Then, again, a variant of the 
word “jostle,” which the original He 
brew will, it ts sald, bear even better, 
la “pass swiftly, without particular 
purpose, to and fro.” Lsn't that the

eays the Journal, “and another ts gen 
tleness, Take it easy. Don't crowd 
the pipe to the top of the bowl, Never 
get a pipe hot, Keep cool, and keep 
your pipe coo, You can relight a pipe, 
and if you are an old sinvker you will 
be all the better for it. When you 
have floished do not refill a heated

WHEEL ROOST, 

Novel Plan for Securing Warmth and 
Comfort to Hens. 

The coziest and most practical de- 
vioe imaginable for furnishing warmth 
and comfort to the hens during win- 
ter nights has recently been su ted. 
After a thorough cleaning of the floor 
in the poultry house a stout hickory 
post about two and one-half inches in 
diameter is driven firmly down about 
three feet from the wall. If the house 
is amall, so a | one is needed, put 
it in a corner. Sharpen the top of this 
stake and set thereon a discarded 
wheel. This makes an ideal roost, one 
which will accommodate from twenty- 
five to thirty hens, according to size 
of wheel. It is remarkable how such 
a roost delights the hens. The spokes 
are all on a level. The rim and spokes 
make a natural foothold, there is no 
falling off, and the Biddies sit in a 
fluffy bunch, as “comfy” as you 
please. 

But the roost is only part of the 
plan. If the wheel is placed in a cor- 
ner the two walls will furnish two 
sides of the proposed “bedroom.” Bet 
4 post of 1 by 2 inch strip four feet 
from each of the side walls. Nail 
other strips from the top of this post 
(which should be two feet higher than 
the wheel) to the side walls. From 
these strips hang a curtain made of 
either canvas, muslin, coarse burlap 
or old carpet, according to conven’ 
ence, wilh 6m be rolled or put up 
in the daytime out of the way. Over 
the top make either a board cover- 
ing or one of the curtain materiai 
In this way the hens are comfortable

even in a cold house. In many re- 
spects burlap is the best curtain ma 
terial, as it admits air, yet is draft 

root, 

4 Tho wheel should not be more than 
90 inches from the floor, The “hop 
up” box will prove a convenience. 
The wheel is also very ensily cleaned. 
Take it outside and after ) py it 
on a bunch of straw fire it for a brief 

ty , or it can be readily sprayed 
frat on one side and then on the 
other, 

The advantages of this scheme, as 
described in Towa Homestead, are evi- 
dent, The old way of fastening the

space thus saved can be kept clean

The Nag on the Doorknod, 

A late home comer, walking through 
the uptown residential section after 
midnight, says the Philadelphia Ree- 
ord, would be surprised to see what ap- 
pears to be white crape hanging from 
hundreds of doors and bell knobs, The 
white thing i# not an indication of a 
child's death, however, but merely a 
bread bag that the baker supplies to 
his customers, For years householders 
had to put up with uncertainty about 
their bread, not knowing whether some 
of the numerous cats that make the 
night less ailent had investigated and 
pawed over thelr morning loaf, But 
now the bakers, tn order that their cus 
tomers might feel more secure, have 
provided these white bags, which the 
housekeeper hangs on the doorknob at 
night and the baker filis carly in the 
morning.

disposition on the part of the Cana- 
dian Pacific to shirk its responsibil-

neglect of the country. 
BLEVATOR QUESTION 

‘“Doring the execul.cn of some of 
the larger works; wholly or partially 
included in the above expenditures, 

traffic was necessarily delayed. The 
second § track now being built he 
tween Winnipeg and Fort William 

will be a source of preat convenience 
when completed, but in the process 
construction the blant ng of rock 
and the of construction 
trains, necessarily deprive us of any 
thing like the full use of the present 
track for traffic purposes I hope, 
however, that by the end of the 
year the hardest part of the work 
will have been completed 

“Might T in conclusion be permit- 
ted to mention the serious extent to 
which railways are deprived of — the 
use of their equipment in Manitoba, 
Saskatchewan and Alberta during 
the busiest season of the year by 
reason of the provisions of the Man 
jtoba grain act governing the allot- 
ment of cars to individual appli 
eants? | know that the purpose of 
the act was to protect farmers in 
the matter of the selling price of 
their wheat Tf legislation could be 
framed that would give farmers this 
same protection while using the ele 
vators that have been provided at 
wost =ostations in the grain-growing 
territory, it would, I am sure facil 
itate the movement of the crop and 
be of advaniage to everyone con
