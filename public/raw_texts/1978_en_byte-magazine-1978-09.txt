About the Cover. . . 

The computer artwork for the 
cover of this issue of BYTE is the 
work of Ed Kellerman, whose article 
appears on page 40. It was done using 
the facilities of IBM in Endicott NY, 
with the APL language as the major 
tool and a Tektronix plotter for pro- 
ducing the black images for the various 
colors of the line drawing component 
of the cover. 

But we looked at the resulting 
artwork, and then asked Ed if he 
would allow us to provide some 
additional hand coloration by Ellen 
Shamonsky of our art department. 
(Ellen is the person responsible for 
the airbrush work on July 1 978's 
cover, which we forgot to credit in 
that issue.) Ellen provided the multi- 
colored airbrush background for the 
present cover, using the artwork 
supplied by Ed as the guide for 
positioning the various zones. 

A background in vectors and 
matrices can give you a set of powerful 
tools for manipulating shapes on a 
graphics display. Read Jeffrey L 
Posdamer's The Mathematics of Com- 
puter Graphics. You may find that the 
mathematics is not as difficult as you 
think. page 22 

As other articles in this issue dem- 
onstrate, matrix operations are one 

method of manipulating graphics. The 
manipulations become simpler when 
the implementation language is de- 
signed to work with matrices. APL is 
such a language. Eduardo Kellerman 
gives us a taste of what happens when 
you mix APL and Graphics. 

page 40 

In this issue Kin-Man Chung and 
Herbert Yuen start a series of articles 
detailing the design and construction 
of A "Tiny" Pascal. Part 1 contains 
an overall view of the project along 
with a detailed look at an interpreter 
for pseudocode which is what the 
Pascal source program will be com- 
piled into. The Pascal project empha- 
sizes the portability of the language by 
compiling from Pascal to pseudocode 
which will then have an individual 
interpreter for every different 
machine. page 58 

What constitutes a program, and 
what is the proper way to write 
one? Proper is a loaded word, but if 
ease of thought and unambiguity are 
goals of the effort, Some Words 
About Program Structure by Albert 
D Hearn will be a good starting point 
for the novice. page 68 

This month we conclude Dr James 
Williams's three part scries on Antique 
Mechanical Computers with Part 3: 
The Torres Chess Automaton. In- 
credible as it may seem, Leonardo 
Torres built a working chess autom- 
aton in 1911. After a discussion about 
early concepts in the first "thinking" 
machines, the chess automaton is 
described in detail in this article. 
Dr Williams concludes the series with 
some philosophical speculations about 
automata. page 82 

Steve Ciarcia completes his de- 
scription of a non-contact scanner 
by describing the software that will 
Let Your Fingers Do the Talking.

In an extended Technical Forum 
discussion, Jonathan Bondy presents 
a preliminary design for S2L: An 

Altaic (S-100) to LSI-11 Bus Adapter. 

Here is a starting point for those 
interested in taking advantage of 
numerous personal computing peri- 
pherals in combination with the 16 
bit Digital Equipment Corporation 
LSI-11 computer. page 102 

If you intend to use your computer 
for arithmetic operations it is neces- 
sary to have a floating point arith- 
metic package. Joel Boney's article 
on implementing a binary floating 
point package will help you imple- 
ment Math in the Real World if you 
don't have an appropriate package 
at your fingertips in a high level 
language or program library, page 114 

A displayed object can be defined 
within a matrix in a program. Once 
the object has been so defined it is a 
simple matter to perform Graphic 
Manipulations Using Matrices as de- 
scribed by Joel Flungerford.

Are you faced with the prospect of 
owning a just built computer system 
bare of all niceties such as BASIC or 
even assembler? Somehow, it is diffi- 
cult to impress noncomputer people 
by adding 1 to I to get 10. Larry 
Kheriaty has an interesting language 
to solve this problem. For Larry's 
solution read WADUZ1TDO-. How to

Less. page 166

Editorial 

On Entering 
Our Fourth Year 

By Carl Helmers 

With this issue, we begin our fourth year 
of publication of BYTE magazine. The pro- 
ject remains as exciting, if not more so, than 
when we first put together an issue of the 
magazine in the summer of 1975. A lot has 
changed as the people involved with this 
publication have grown and learned about 
the process of magazine production. Yet a 
lot remains similar. 

The basic goal of this magazine is not 
likely to change: to provide readers with a 
continuing stream of novel ideas and infor- 
mation about computers and related fields. 

The assumption made about the BYTE 
reader is that he or she possesses curiosity 
combined with a willingness to experiment 
with and learn about topics related to com- 
puters and computing. To this end we pro- 
vide a wealth of tutorials on hardware and 
software aspects of computer science — as 
well as specific "do it yourself" items on 
neat projects which can be done by the 
reader. And all this is lied together with an 
emphasis on the fun which can be had 
through the use of computing technology in 
various ways. 

We started out with this idea about the 
goals of the magazine, and no real know- 
ledge about how far we could take it. After 
all, the skeptics (on occasion including 
myself) would ask, can there be that many 
people interested enough in computers to 
buy your magazine? But, reflecting the 
growth of personal computing manufactur- 
ing, we went from a 96 page black and white 
first issue to a 208 page typical current 
issue, from essentially circulation as of 
the decision to start the magazine to a pre- 
sent circulation in excess of 140,000 paid 
copies per month. Perhaps we even played a 
small part in promoting that growth by 
providing our advertising and editorial 
content as a service to the industry."

nHBH 

soi: 

The small computer 
that won't 

fence you in. 

A lot of semantic nonsense is 
being tossed around by some of the 
makers of so-called "personal" 
computers. To hear them tell it, an 
investment of a few hundred 
dollars will give you a computer to 
run your small business, do a 
great amount of financial planning, 
analyze a host of data in the 
engineering or scientific lab and 
when day is done play games 
by the hour. 

Well, the games part is true. 
The rest of the claims should be 
taken with a grain of salt. All of 
the personal computers will help 
you learn about computers and 
how they work in general and the 
kinds of things they can do for 
you. Only a few have the capacity 
to grow and handle meaningful 
work in a very real sense. And they 
don't come for peanuts. 

Remember, there's no 
free lunch. 

So before you buy any personal 
computer, consider Sol," the small 
computer. Consider it because it 
costs more at the start so in the 
end it costs less. Consider it because 
it can grow with the complexity 
of the tasks you ask it to perform 
and grow with your ability to 
use it. No, it's not cheap. But it's 
not a delusion either. 

From the very beginning, Sol 
small computer systems were 
designed to be at the very top of the 
microcomputer spectrum. We 
designed them so you wouldn't have 
to add costly extras to do many 
jobs. We designed them so you could 
add quality peripherals and more 
memory to take care of more 
complex tasks. We designed them 

to use the best fully supported 
disk operating system on the market 
today, PTDOS, which we also 
designed. We designed them to use 
our Helios II mass memory. And 
for Sol small computer systems we 
designed new and adapted existing 
software to give you the choice of 
the best on the market today. 

Build computer power 
with our software. 

No system is complete without 
software, and at Processor 
Technology we have tailored a 
group of high level languages, 
and assembler and other packages 
to suit the wide capabilities of 
our hardware. 

Take a look at our exclusive 
Extended BASIC as an example. In 
cassette form, this BASIC features 
string and advanced file handling, 
special screen commands, timed 
input, complete matrix, logarithmic 
and trigonometric functions, 
8 digit precision and square root. 
The language handles serial 
access files, provides tape rewind 
and offers cursor control for 
graphics capability. 

The disk version has all the 
number crunching talents of the 
cassette BASIC plus instant 
access to data and programs on 
floppy disks. It includes 
random as well as sequential files 
and a unique ability to update 
sequential data in place. 

Processor Technology FORTRAN 
is similar to FORTRAN IV and 
has a full set of extensions designed 
for the "stand alone" computer 
environment. Thousands of special 
application programs available 
through books and periodicals have 

already been written in this well 
established language.

The official attendance was 57,240— 
that's how many people came to the 
National Computer Conference in Anaheim 
CA June 5 thru 8. 

Easily the biggest computer show in 
history, the NCC overflowed the huge 
Anaheim convention center into a neigh- 
boring garage annex converted to handle 
the extra booths. The personal computing 
section of the show has grown into a major 
show of its own in just two years: the 
crowds there were no less impressive than 
at the main show. 

A diversity of products greeted visitors 
to the show: everything from digitizers to 
compilers; Pascal to peripherals; color video 
systems to surplus parts; and so on. One of 
the most significant hardware devices on 
view was an 8 K content addressable 
memory board for the S-100 bus from 
Semionics in Berkeley CA. In a normal 
memory, the address of data is input, and 
the memory reads from (or writes to) its

The first entries competed in the amazing 
Micro Mouse Maze contest, cosponsored by 
IEEE Computer and Spectrum magazines. 
The object was to design a self-powered 
electronic "mouse" that could solve a maze 
in the fastest possible time. The sponsors 
of the contest were amazed (pun intended) 
at the response to the contest call: over 
6000 people wrote for contest kits. Maze 
trials will be conducted at various computer 
shows over the next two years before a 
winner is declared. 

These are just some of the highlights of 
a tremendous show. Next year the NCC 
will be in New York City. If attendance 
figures continue to climb at this rate, they'll 
have to hold the show in Madison Square

Why Apple! 
st selling pei 

h the world's 
tonal computer. 

'hich personal computer will be 
most enjoyable and rewarding for you? 
Since we delivered our first Apple® II 
in April, 1977, more people have chosen 
our computer than all other personal 
computers combined. Here are the 
reasons Apple has become such an 
overwhelming favorite. 

Apple is a fully tested and assembled 
mainframe computer. You won't need 
to spend weeks and months in assembly. 
Just take an Apple home, plug it in, 
hook up your color TV* and any cassette 
tape deck — and the fun begins. 

To ensure that the fun never stops, 
and to keep Apple working hard, we've 
spent the last year expanding the Apple 
system. There are new peripherals, 
new software, and the Apple II Basic 
Programming Manual. And wait till 
you see the Apple magazine to keep 

owners on top of what's new. 

Apple is so powerful and easy to use 
that you'll find dozens of applications. 
There are Apples in major universities, 
helping teach computer skills. There 
are Apples in the office, where they're 
being programmed to control inven- 
tories, chart stocks and balance the 
books. And there are Apples at home, 
where they can help manage the family 
budget, control your home's environ- 
ment, teach arithmetic and foreign 
languages and, of course, enable you 
to create hundreds of sound and 
action video games. 

When you buy an Apple II you're 
investing in the leading edge of tech- 
nology. Apple was the first computer 
to come with BASIC in ROM, for 
example. And the first computer with 
up to 48K bytes RAM on one board, 
using advanced, high density 16K 
devices. We're working to keep Apple 
the most up-to-date personal computer 
money can buy. Apple II delivers the 
features you need to enjoy the real 

satisfaction a personal computer can 
bring, today and in the future. 

15 colors & hi-resolution 
graphics, too. 

Don't settle for a black and 
white display! Connect your 
Apple to a color TV and 
BASIC gives you instant 
command of three display 
modes: Text, 40h x 48v 
Color-graphics in 15 colors, 
and a 280h x 192v High 
Resolution 
array that 
lets you plot 
graphs and 
compose 
3-D images. 
Apple gives 
you the added 
capability of combining 
text and graphics, too. 

Back to basics, and 
assembly language too. 

Apple speaks three languages: fast 
integer BASIC, floating point BASIC 
for scientific and financial applications, 
and 6502 assembly language. That's 
maximum programming flexibility. And, 
to preserve user's space, both integer 
BASIC and monitor are permanently 
stored in 8K bytes of ROM, so you 
have an easy-to-use, universal language 
instantly available. BASIC gives you 
graphic commands: COLOR=, VLIN, 
HLIN, PLOT and SCRN. And direct 
memory access, with PEEK, POKE 
and CALL commands. 

Software: Ours and yours. 

There's a growing selection of pre- 
programmed software from the Apple 
Software Bank — Basic 
Finance, Checkbook, High 
Resolution Graphics and 
more. Now there's a User 
Section in our bank, to make 
it easy for you to obtain 
programs developed 

by other Apple owners. Our Software 
Bank is your link to Apple owners all 
over the world. 

Alive with 
the sound 
of music. 

Apple's ex- 
clusive built-in 
speaker delivers 
the added dimension of sound to your 
programs. Sound to compose electronic 
music. Sound to liven up games and 
educational programs. Sound, so that 
any program can "talk" back to you. 
That's an example of Apple's "people 
compatible" design. Another is its light, 
durable injection- molded case, so you 
can take Apple with you. And the 
professional quality, typewriter-style 
keyboard has n-key rollover, for fast, 
error-free operator interaction. 

Apple is the 
proven computer. 

Apple is a state-of-the-art single 
board computer, with advanced LSI 
design to keep component count to a 
minimum. That makes it more reliable. 
If glitches do occur, the fully socketed 
board and built-in diagnostics sim- 
plify troubleshooting. In fact, on our 
assembly line, we use Apples to 
test new Apples. 

* Apple II plugs into any standard TV using 
an inexpensive modulator (not included).

Apple peripherals 
are smart peripherals. 

Watch the far right column of this ad 
each month for the latest in our grow- 
ing family of peripherals. We call them 
"intelligent interfaces." They're smart 
peripherals, so you can plug them in 
and run them from BASIC without 
having to develop custom software. 
No other personal computer comes 
close to Apple's expandability. In addi- 
tion to the built-in video interface, cas- 
sette I/O, and four A/D inputs with two 
continuously variable game paddles, 
Apple has eight peripheral slots, three 
TTL inputs and four TTL outputs. Plus 
a powerful, state-of-the-art switching 
power supply that can drive all your 
Apple peripherals.

A Solid State Keyboard as Modem as Your Computer 

Solid state electronics has moved the computer quickly from the business world into personal uses. 
Meanwhile, computer keyboards have hardly moved at all. 

Now TASA introduces a keyboard as modern as your computer. Don't confuse it with ordinary flex switches. It 
is fully solid state and self-contained, ready to plug in and use. Since it has no mechanical moving parts, it 
responds quickly to your touch. And it provides full ASCII coding in TASA's exclusive color-keyed layout that 
makes it easier to say what you want to say to your computer. 

This is the TASA Micro Proximity Keyboard, and it sells for only $49.95. Despite the price, CMOS/LSI 
integrated circuits make it totally reliable inside. With the sensors behind a shield of polycarbonate —the most 
rugged plastic ever developed — it is also durable and reliable outside. 

The TASA Keyboard contains all the features you would expect in a professional keyboard — shift, shift lock, 
control functions, and a normal typewriter format. 

If you're tired of costly mechanical keyboards and kits you have to assemble, bring your computer up to date 
the easy way. Plug in a TASA Keyboard. It will never come between you and your computer.

WANTED: A RANDOM NUMBER 
CIRCUIT 

Writing a really good pseudorandom 
number generator is not an easy thing to 
do; Knuth devoted half a volume to the 
process. Also, if you base a computer 
game on a pseudorandom number gen- 
erator, you have the awkward problem 
of supplying a seed for each game. For 
these reasons, I would like a way of get- 
ting truly random numbers into a micro- 
processor. One way to do this is to have 
the computer increment a counter while 
waiting for the user to enter something. 
If the computer is fast enough, the low 
order bits of the counter will be random. 
However, this method is not good for 
generating large numbers of random 
numbers, since the user must be con- 
sulted for each one. What I really want is 
a circuit which generates random bits. 
I've heard that such circuits exist, 
based on something called "noisy" 
diodes. Where can I get details? 

Scott D Johnson

Certain processors, like the Zilog 
Z-80, have methods of apparently form- 
ing a random seed number. Since the 
hidden refresh counter for dynamic 
memory is always in operation it can be 
paged whenever a seed for a pseudo- 
random number generator is required. 
Within certain constraints it may also 
be possible to use a series of these num- 
bers as pseudorandom numbers. 

WHAT A SMALL COMPUTER CAN 

DO FOR THE MULTIPLY 

HANDICAPPED 

Being extremely green at this com- 
puter game and having no hardware 
experience (come to think of it no 
experience whatever) I have only had 
my Apple about three weeks, but I 
have a glimpse of the tremendous 
possibilities now open to me. 

Since breaking my neck whilst 
on National Service in Germany, I've 
been able to move my head, left, right 
and slightly backwards and forwards 
and that's my lot. If anyone tries lying 
on the floor on his back, using the 
above movements and tries writing 
his name with a pen in his mouth (hold- 
ing a pad above) they will quickly 
realise there's not a big variety of things 
someone in my position can do. 

Now imagine the same person with 
the keyboard of a computer in front of 
him you find the limits go up tenfold. 

I know there are machines like 
"Possom" issued in certain cases by 
the UK government. It will connect 
the disabled to TV telephone, it will 
open doors and curtains, and work 
a typewriter, about a dozen functions 
and it costs between £1,400 and £1,600 
depending on the number of functions. 

The processor I have is an "Apple II" 
16 K and because I have to work with a 
stick in my mouth, the shift and control 
keys have had to be modified so that 
they work like a typewriter and use two 
movements to lock and release. 

The Apple has opened up a new 
world I didn't know existed. It now 
makes jobs possible, the design and 
colour graphics and all the games (and 
don't knock the games, remember 
your capabilities while lying on the 
floor) and all this at a touch with a 
stick, and at costs comparable with 
"Possom." 

All I have to do now is buckle down 
and do a lot of studying and practicing. 

I hope this gives some of your 
readers a glimpse of what a computer 
could do for the disabled and severely 
disabled. Also wonder if they have the 
same problem I have of doing a bit more, 
and a bit more to find it's 3 AM, or later, 
and that you have to force yourself to 
turn that switch off.

If you are interested in an ultra high per- 
formance personal computer which can be 
fully expanded to a mainframe class micro- 
computer system, consider the C2-8P. 

Features: 

■ Minimally equipped with 8K BASIC-in-ROM, 4K RAM, 
machine code monitor, video display interface, cassette 
interface and keyboard with upper and lower case 
characters. (Video monitor and cassette recorder optional 
extras.) 

I The fastest full feature BASIC in the microcomputer 
industry. 

; Boasts the most sophisticated video display in per- 
sonal computing with 32 rows by 64 columns of upper 
case, lower case, graphics and gaming elements for an ef- 
fective screen resolution of 256 by 512 elements. 

! The CPU's direct screen access, coupled with its ultra 
fast BASIC and high resolution, makes the C2-8P capable 
of spectacular video animation directly in BASIC. 
■ Fully assembled and tested: 8 slot mainframe class 
microcomputer, six open slots for expansion. Supports 
Ohio Scientific's ultra low cost dynamic RAM boards or 
ultra high reliability static RAMs. 

The C2-8P can support more in-case expansion than its 
four nearest competitors combined. 

The C2-8P is the only BASIC-in-ROM computer that can 
be directly expanded today to a complete business 
system with line printer and 8" floppy disk drives. 

It is the only personal class computer that can be 
expanded to support a Hard Disk! (CD-74) 

The C2-8P is the fastest in BASIC, has the most sophisti- 
cated video display and is the most internally expandable 
personal computer. Therefore, it should be the highest 
priced? 

Wrong: The C2-8P is priced considerably below several 
models advertised in this magazine. The C2-8P is just one 
of several models of personal computers by Ohio 
Scientific, the company that first offered full feature 
BASIC-in-ROM personal computers.

The world's most powerful 

microcomputer system 

is fer more affordable 

than you may think: 

STANDARD FEATURES: 

■ 74 million byte Winchester tech- 
nology disk drive yields mainframe 
class file access speeds and 
capacity. 

■ High level data file software 
makes high performance file struc- 
tures like multikey ISAM easy to 
use. 

Triple processor CPU with 
6502A, 6800 and Z-80 gives the pro- 
grammer the best of all worlds in 
performance and versatility. 

The included 6502A based ex- 
tended disk BASIC by Microsoft 
out-benchmarks every micro 
available, including 4 MHz Z-80 and 
LSI-11 with extended arithmetic. 

48K of high reliability static RAM 
is standard. 

High density 8" floppys provide 
program and data mobility from 
machine to machine. 

■ Completely integrated mechani- 
cal system with UL-recognized 
power supplies; continuous duty 
cycle cooling; modular construc- 
tion and rack slide mounted 
subassemblies. 

■ Based on a 16 slot Bus-oriented 
architecture with only 7 slots used 
in the base machine. 

■ Directly expandable to 300 
megabytes of disk, 768K of RAM in 
16 partitions, 16 communication 
ports, plus console and three 
printers. 

C3-B's have been in production 
since February, 1978, and are 
available now on very reasonable 
delivery schedules. 

The C3-B was designed by Ohio 
Scientific as the state of art in 

Circle 290 on inquiry card. 

small business computing. The 
system places its power where it's 
needed in the small business 
environment; in the data files. The 
C3-B's advanced Winchester tech- 
nology disk, coupled with its smart 
controller and dedicated high 
speed memory channel, gives the 
C3-B data file performance com- 
parable with today's most powerful 
maxi-computers. 

Yet, the C3-B costs only slightly 
more than many floppy only com- 
puters but offers at least a thou- 
sand times performance improve- 
ment over such machines (50 times 
storage capacity multiplied by 20 
times access speed improvement). 

But what if your business client 
cannot justify starting with a C3-B? 

Then start with Ohio Scientific's in- 
expensive C3-S1 floppy disk based 
system running OS-65U. When he is 
ready, add the CD-74 big disk and 
directly transfer programs and files 
from floppy to big disk with NO 
modifications. 

That's upward expandability! 

* Rack as shown above complete 
with 74 megabyte disk, dual 
floppys, 48K of static RAM, OS-65U 
operating system and one CRT ter- 
minal under $13,000. 

Multiple terminal systems with 
printers and applications software 
are priced in the mid-20's.

The Mathematics of 

Computer graphics by Joel Hungerford 

Graphic assistance by Vivian Day 

Computer Graphics 

The personal computing literature is filled 
with material describing the hardware of 
microprocessors using video graphics. A 
great deal has also been written about spe- 
cific graphic applications including video 
games, computer art, etc. Computer graphics 
is, however, a powerful tool that requires for 
its use an understanding of a set of under- 
lying computingand mathematical principles. 
The purpose of this article is to present some 
of these principles in the context of personal 
computing. 

The screen of a video display is essentially 
a space with two dimensions. While a num- 
ber of schemes exist for dealing with two- 
dimensional spaces, the most common is 

Cartesian coordinates. Each point in the 
space is represented by a pair of numbers 
corresponding to its distance from two axes 
at right angles to each other. On a video 
display this pair of numbers corresponds to 
the scan line number and picture element 
within the scan line. The notation [x y] will 
be used here to denote the element number 
and scan line number. Due to the nature of 
displays, the values for x and y are integers 
of limited range. Each pair of values corres- 
ponds to a unique point in the display space. 
For many problems in which computer 
graphics is useful, a second space is used. 
This is the problem space (see figure 1). This 
corresponds to the description of the prob- 
lem geometry as opposed to the screen. The 
representation [u v] will be used here for 
problem spaces. For Space War its dimen- 
sions may be measured in parsecs, for a ten- 
nis simulation it may be measured in inches, 
etc. Problem spaces may be integer or real, 

Figure i: Problem space versus display space. The screen of a video display is 
essentially a space with two dimensions, commonly addressed by integer 
Cartesian coordinates. In creating graphics images, it is often useful to per- 
form calculations in what is called a problem space and later map onto the 
display space. For instance, if you are creating a game of action football for 
your graphics display, it may be more useful to perform the calculations with 
u and v coordinates measured in yards (your problem space) and later con- 
vert to the display space with its integer coordinates.

bounded or unbounded and are defined by 
the nature of the problem, not the use of 
computer graphics as a tool. 

Naturally, there must be a way to convert 
from one space to the other when both are 
used. If 

xsmin = left screen value 

xsmax = right screen value 

ysmin = bottom screen value 

ysmax = top screen value 

upmin = minimum problem space u 

coordinate value 
upmax = maximum problem space u 

coordinate value 
vpmin = minimum problem space v 

coordinate value 
vpmax = maximum problem space v 

coordinate value 

and 

then the point [u v] in problem space 
maps into a point [x y] in screen space as 
follows: 

u '"P m//7 . ) X (xsmax-xsmin) + 

upmax-upmin 
{xsmin) 

y = 

—£■ — - — — ) X {ysmax-ysmin) + 

vpmax-vpmm 
{ysmin 

In most cases, operating on individual 
points is only a beginning. Generally, tech- 
niques are needed to deal with line segments 
that connect points to define figures and 
regions. 

If two points Po = I x oyof anc ' p 1 = 
[x] yi] are to be connected by a line seg- 
ment, it is often necessary to compute every 
point on the connecting line (see figure 2). A 
traditional representation of the straight line 
is of the form: 

y = mx + b 

where 

V 1 -V 
: ^-^andb = y -(x X m). 

M" A 

To compute the series of points that would 
represent the line segment connecting Pq 
and P-|, a program would start with the 
point at (xg,yo) a dd m X A x to yg and A x 
to xq enough times to reach x-| and y-| (A x 
means a small increment of x). It is impor- 
tant to realize that m, b and the interme- 
diate values of x and y may take on non- 
integer values. For each intermediate point, 
the rounded values of x and y are used to 
designate a picture element to be displayed 
as part of the line's representation. 

An alternative to this scheme is the "para- 
metric" line representation. Here, the mathe- 
matical representation of the infinite line 
that passes through Pq and P-\ is not used. 

Figure 2: The straight line, a basic element 
in many displays. If two points are to be 
connected by a line segment, in a raster 
graphic display it is necessary to calculate 
every point on the connecting line. In the 
case of a vector display, only the endpoints 
of the vector need be computed. 

Instead, we represent only the points be- 
tween Pq and Pi : 

X = (1— t)X Q + tX- = Xq + tlX-— Xq) 

y = d-t)v + 1 v 1 = v + ^-Yq) 

where t varies from to 1 
(x,y) = (x Q ,y )at t = 
(x,y) - (x 1 ,v 1 ) att = 1 

A line similar to the above line is generated, 
but with simpler, more direct computations. 

For more advanced systems, a number of 
hardware schemes for line generation exist. 
Since hardware is not the topic of discussion 
in this article, refer to reference 1 for a dis- 
cussion of binary rate multipliers, digital 
differential analyzers and multiplying digital 
to analog converters. 

Another basic graphics element is the 
polygon. The polygon is a plane figure 
consisting of all points inside and on the 
boundary of a simply connected series of 
straight lines. For our purposes it is more 
convenient to represent a polygon by a list 
of its vertices than by a list of the entire set 
of displayed points. Polygons raise the issue 
of the differences between video or raster 
displays and line drawing vector or calli- 
graphic displays. 

The line drawing display has been a 
standard graphics device. It contains hard- 
ware to draw lines between points in the 
screen space. The image is drawn by tracing 
over each line in the image in the order the 
lines were specified. Thus, only points on 
displayed lines are scanned. 

The raster display uses a fixed scanning 
pattern that covers the entire screen. At

screen positions which are parts of the 
displayed image, the scanning beam is 
intensified, causing images to appear on the 
screen. On a line drawing display, polygons 
can be represented by their boundaries; on a 
raster display they can be "colored in." 

Displaying Polygons 

A polygon is represented by an ordered 
set of points: (x ,y ), (xi,y|), . . . (x n ,y n ). 
An alternative notation for this collection is 
a matrix: 

M 

X 1 V 1 

y 1 V n 

n n1 m n2 

Each element of the matrix is a number, 
specified by its row index and column index. 
In memory, arrays are typically stored in 
consecutive locations in either row or 
column order. It is necessary to calculate an 
element address from the row and column 
indices of a particular element in order to 
access it. 

Given the vertices, how can the displayed 
interior points be calculated? Let us assume 
(as is usually the case) that the display scans 
from top to bottom and from left to right. 
For each line segment in the polygon, deter- 
mine the vertex with the maximum y value 
and sort the edges in descending order 
by the maximum y value. Every vertex 
in the polygon is now represented in two 
places: as the beginning and end of two 
lines. Beginning with the topmost vertex, a 
line generation algorithm is used on any line 
that crosses the current y value. Because of 
the sort that was performed, line segments 
which begin lower on the screen may be 
ignored. Since both ends of the line segment 
are present, a line is dropped from the 
computation when its "lower" end is passed. 
For every line passing through the current 
y value, the x value has been calculated. The 
points generated are now sorted by x value. 

Starting with the minimum x value, fill in 
picture elements on the scan line until the 
next value is encountered; leave empty 
picture elements until another picture 
element (if any) is encountered. As the 
program scans from left to right, the x values 
occupying odd numbered positions (1st, 
3rd. . .) in the x-sorted list cause picture 
element insertion to begin; the even position 
elements cause picture element insertion to 

be superseded. Figure 3 shows how this 
process can be generalized and applied to an 
arbitrary plane figure in outline form, ie: a 
letter "P." This procedure is repeated as the 
y value is stepped down the screen space 
for each scan line until the "lowest" vertex 
is encountered, ending the figure. 

Transformations 

Now that the basic graphic elements have 
been defined in terms of points and a set of 
algorithms which generate lines and arbitrary 
figures from the points, it is necessary to 
examine the operations needed to manipu- 
late points to perform useful tasks. There are 
three basic transformations in two dimen- 
sions: translation, rotation, and scaling or 
magnification. 

Translation is the movement of a point or 
points by an amount in x and an amount in 
y. The motion is such that neither the shape, 
size nor orientation is changed. It may be 
expressed as: 

x' = x + changex 
y' = y + changey 

where the changex need not equal changey. 

If all of the points associated with a line 
or figure are translated by an equal amount, 
the graphic element is translated without 
change in size, shape or orientation. Figure 4

Figure 3: Creating a letter P with a raster 
scanning video display. During each scan line 
the program creates blanks until it comes to 
the first line. After this point it creates solid 
picture elements until it encounters the next 
line, whereupon it switches back to blanks. 
The algorithm states that solid picture 
elements should follow odd numbered line 
intersections and that blanks should follow 
even numbered line intersections.

The North Star 16K RAM board is a star performer 
in our HORIZON computer. Just as important, it is the 
ideal memory for most other S-100 bus systems. No other 
RAM board can surpass the speed, reliability, and quality 
features of the North Star 16K RAM at any price. 

SPEED — The North Star 16K RAM is the fastest S-100 
bus memory board available. No wait states are required, 
even with a Z80 at 4MHz. And, of course, this outstand- 
ing 16K RAM will operate with both 8080 and Z80 proc- 
essors at 2MHz. Industry standard 200ns dynamic RAM 
chips are used. Invisible on-board refresh circuitry allows 
the processor to run at full speed. 

RELIABILITY — The North Star 16K RAM is designed to 
match the same high standards as our MICRO DISK 
SYSTEM and HORIZON computer. For example, all ad- 
dress and data signals are fully buffered. A parity check 
option is available with the 16K RAM for applications re- 
quiring immediate hardware error detection. If a memory 

error occurs, a status flip/flop is set and an interrupt can 
inform the processor. Or, if preferred, an error status 
light will go on. 

FEATURES —The North Star 16K RAM offers many de- 
sirable features. Addressability is switch-selectable to 
start at any 8K boundary. The board can perform bank 
switching for special software applications, such as time- 
sharing. Also, bank switching can be used to expand the 
amount of RAM beyond 64K bytes. Power consumption 
is minimal — the maximum power requirements are: 
.6A @ 8V; .4A @ +16V, and .1A @ -16V. 

PRICES — $399 kit. $459 assembled, tested and burned- 
in. Parity option: $39 Kit. $59 assembled, tested and 
burned-in.

Figure 4: Translation in the xy plane. 

Figure 6: Rotation of vector about the origin. 

shows the effect of a translation applied to 
our arbitrary figure, the letter "P." Rotation 
is a somewhat different problem. It involves 
a computation which maintains shape 
but changes orientation. A rotation will 
generally leave only one point in the two- 
dimensional space with its position un- 
changed: the center of rotation. For the 
sake of simplicity, the rotation computation 
is developed with the point (0,0) as the 
center of rotation. The polar coordinate 
representation is used (see figure 5). Later it 
will be shown how to rotate about any 
arbitrary point. The point to be rotated, Prj, 
is at position (xrj.yo) (see figure 6). This is 
at a distance r from (0,0) and the line from 
the origin to P makes an angle of a with the 
x axis. From trigonometry we know that: 

Xq = r cos(a) 
y Q = r sin(a) 

If Pq is rotated about (0,0) by an angle of b 
to become Pi then 

x- = r cos(a+b) 
y- = r sin(a+b) 

but from trigonometry we may substitute 

for the sum-of-angles form: 

x = r cos(a) cos(b) - r sin(a) sin(b) 
y. = r cos(a) sin(b) + r sin(a) cos(b) 

but from above we get 
x 

_ cos(b) - y sin(b) 

Figure 5: Polar coordinate representation 
of a point in the xy plane. 

The last of the basic transformations is 
scaling or magnification. This involves a 
change in size without change in orientation. 
Depending on the definition of shape, it is 
either unchanged or changed "without 
distortion." As in rotation, only a single 
point in the plane is unchanged by a partic- 
ular scaling transformation and once again, 
for convenience, the origin [0 0] is left 
unchanged. The equations: 

V 1 =SV 

will scale x and y by a factor s. The factor 
may be greater than or less than 1. If a 
negative value is used for s, then reflection 
about the origin is performed. If the scale 
factors for x and y are different, then 
"stretching" is accomplished. Figure 7 
illustrates several scaling transformations 
applied to the "P" figure seen in several 
eariier illustrations. 

Vectors and Matrices 

The use of matrix notation allows simpli- 
fied extensions and combinations of the 
basic transformations. A matrix is a rectan- 
gular array of numbers identified by row and 
column numbers. Every row in a particular 
matrix has the same number of entries, as 
does every column. The notation A(I,J) 
refers to the element of matrix A in the Ith 
row and Jth column. A matrix has a size 
associated with it, [re], which defines the

number of rows and number of columns. 
For matrices A, B and C each having the 
same number of rows and columns, the 
following rules are true: 

A = B if A(I,J) = B(I,J) for all elements 

A = B+C when A(I,J) = B(I,J) + C(I,J) for all 

elements 
A = B-C when A(I,J) = B(I,J) - C(I,J) for 

all elements 

While addition and subtraction of matrices 
follow in fairly simple fashion from scalar 
(nonmatrix) arithmetic rules, multiplication 
and operations similar to division are not at 
all similar. (A scalar is a quantity that is 
completely specified by a single number, 
compared with multiple number data 
constructs, which are vectors and matrices.) 

A matrix with only one row is called a 
row vector. Similarly, a matrix with only 
one column is called a column vector. The 
subject of matrix multiplication is first 
examined with these simplified forms. While 

isi > I s = + 1.5 

ORIGINAL FIGURE S=l 

Figure 7: Scaling an arbitrary figure in the 
xy plane. 

there are two forms of vector multiplication, 
only the dot product (also called the vector- 
inner-product) is presented here. Again, 
using a matrix A (the row vector), B (the 
column vector) and C (their product) the 
vector product computation will be de- 
scribed. A vector product can exist only if 
the number of elements in A and the num- 
ber of elements in B are equal. If each of 
these has N elements then 

C = A(1,1)X B(1,1) + A(2,1) X B(1,2) . . . + 
A(N,1) X B(N,1). 

This is called the dot product of the two 
vectors. It is the sum of the pairwise products 
of their elements. C, the dot product of the 
two vectors, is a single number (a scalar) not 
a vector or matrix. For example: 

let 

A = [1 2 3 4] 

3' 
B= 5 
7 
11 

row vector 

column vector 

then 

AB = C= 1X3 + 2X5 + 3X7+4X11 =78 

Now suppose that A and B arc not restricted 
to one column and one row, respectively. 
Instead, we let A have size [ta Ca] and B 
have size [rgCg].The matrix product can 
only be computed if Ca=i"d: that is, the 
number of columns in A is equal to the 
number of rows of B. Two matrices for 
which this is true are called conformable. C 
will now have size [r a, eg] , inheriting its size 
from both A and B. Each element in C 
(which is no longer a scalar) results from the 
dot product of a row in A with a column in 
B: 

C(I,J) 

A(l,1) X B(1,J) + A(l,2) X B(2,J).

For any matrix M there is a special matrix 
which, when multiplied by M, yields M. This 
is called the identity matrix (I). It is similar 
in role to the value 1 in scalar multiplication. 
Naturally, the identity matrix must be con- 
formable with a particular M. I is a square 

matrix, with zeros everywhere but on the 
diagonal, where the value 1 is placed. The 
diagonal is the set of elements where the row 
index equals the column index. For example, 
if I and M are both 3 by 3 matrices, then 
IM = M: 

1 o 
o 1 

M = M 

Now let's turn back to rotations, and see 
how these may be applied to a collection of 
points describing a figure on the display 
screen. 

Two comments are worth noting at this 
stage. It is often useful and necessary to 
apply the same transformation to several 
points. This occurs when applying a trans- 
formation to items such as polygons or more 
complex collections of points. Additionally, 
it is useful to combine basic transformations 
to create more complex transformations. 

A collection of points may be represented 
as a matrix: 

K o y o 

Recall the basic operations of scaling, rota- 
tion and translation: 

Scaling (about the origin) 
X 1 = s x x 

V 1 =S y V 

Rotation (about the origin) 
x- = x_ cos(b) — y Q sin(b) 

'1 

x sin(b) + y Q cos(b) 

Translation 

x - = x + changex 
V 1 = V + changey. 

If these transformations could be represented 
as appropriate matrices, they could be 
applied simultaneously to all points in the 
collection. Scaling may be represented in 
matrix form as: 

[x'y'] = [xy] 

or, for a collection of points: 

~ x b 

V b" 

_ 

~ x 

y o" 

s 

X 

x' 
n 

v n 

X 

n 

v n 

s v_ 

Rotation through angle b about the origin 
may be represented as: 

cos(b) sin(b) 

-sin(b) cos(b) 

Translation presents a somewhat more 
difficult problem. No 2 by 2 transformation 
matrix can be devised that will transform a 
group of points by a uniform displacement. 
An alternative representation of the transla- 
tion is: 

x '- (xH + (y)0 + 1 ■ changex 
V '= (x)0 + (y)1 + 1 • changey 

If we now represent all points in two- 
dimensional space with a 3 element vector of 
the form [x y 1 ] for the point at [x y] , then 
the translation operation may be represented 
in matrix form as 

changex changey 1 

Note that a third (unnecessary) column is 
added to the translation matrix to make the 
results have the same dimensions as the 
input points. 

The scaling matrix is now rewritten as: 

The rotation matrix is now: 

cos(b) sin(b) 

-sin(b) cos(b) 

1 

The use of an n+1 element vector to repre- 
sent a point in n-dimensional space is known 
as the use of homogeneous coordinates. 

Now that a uniform representation, the 
3 by 3 matrix, is available for transforma- 
tions, two questions arise: (1 ) How can more 
complex transformations be implemented? 
(2) What effects are obtained from matrices 
which do not fit into the special structures 
generated for the basic transformations? 

Most complex geometric operations may

be implemented as a sequence of basic 
operations. A few examples arc examined 
next. 

Rotation About an Arbitrary Point [x r y r 1] 

Since wc know how to rotate about the 
origin, the point R and the object arc first 
moved to the origin. The object is then 
rotated and the system moved back so that 
R is at its original location. A matrix repre- 
sentation of this procedure is shown in 
example 1. The point R will be unchanged 
by this sequence of transformations. Trans- 
formations arc not generally commutative; 
ie: the order of application of the trans- 
formations Is fixed to achieve a particular 
combined result. 

A similar statement is true for matrix 
multiplication: 

AB i BA in general. 

But, matrix multiplication is associative. 
Thai is, if the order of the matrices is fixed, 
the order in which the individual multiplica- 
tions is performed does not matter as far as 
the value of the result is concerned. Thus, in 
the example shown, we could combine the 
last three (transformation) matrices by 
multiplication to yield a single 3 by 3 matrix 
which represents the combined transforma- 
tion. If more than three points are repre- 
sented in the coordinate matrix, this tech- 
nique will reduce the amount of computa- 
tion necessary to calculate the result. 

As a general comment, it is useful to 
decompose complex transformations into 
a series of basic transformations. Any 
transformation which preserves shape in the 
sense discussed above can be decomposed 
into a series of basic transformations repre- 
sented as matrices. The product of these 
matrices will be the matrix representation of 
the complex transformation. 

A general 3 by 3 matrix might be repre- 
sented by: 

b c 
e f 
i J 

(h intentionally omitted) 

Three special cases of this matrix have been 
presented that represent the basic trans- 
formations. While the products of such basic 
transformations can yield many of the cases 
of the general T3 matrix, it is useful to 
examine some other simple cases. The 3 by 3 
identity matrix: 

1 

1 

1 

yields a result identical to the original set of 
points. This is a null transformation. The 
effect of setting elements a and e (referring 
to the general T3 matrix elements) equal to 
other values results in scaling. Setting 
elements g and /' to nonzero values creates a 
translation. The process of setting element 
b to a nonzero value is shown in the follow- 
ing equations: 

x' = X 

y' = bx + y . 

The effect of this change on our figure "P" 
test pattern is shown in figure 9. This type 
of transformation is known as a y shear. 
Note how the "P" has been distorted in the 
y direction only by this operation. 

Figure 9: An example of y shear.

Figure 10: An example of x shear. 

Similarly, setting element d equal to a 
nonzero value causes an x shear as shown in 
figure 10: 

x' = x + rfy 

v' = y 

If element c or element f is nonzero, or if 
element / is not one, the result of the trans- 
formation is of the form: 

h-¥= 1 

[hxhyh] 

Here, hx and hy are considered to be bilit- 
eral (2 letter) symbols or variable names, 
not products of h and x ox y. In this case, we 
divide each element of the vector by the last 
(or homogeneous) element. Thus, the 
coordinates of the point (x,y) in two-space 
may be represented by an infinite number of 
homogeneous representations [hxhyh]. 
The process of dividing through by the 
homogeneous coordinate is known as homo- 
geneous normalization (see table 1). 

A particular problem arises when h = 0. 
In this case, division is undefined. An under- 
standing of this situation is attained by 
letting/) go to zero. 

The value of the normalized point in 
table 1 goes out along a line from the origin 
through the point [a b] ; as h approaches 
zero, the point goes to infinity. Thus the 
representation [obO] defines a point at 

Editor's Note: Analogies Between Hardware and Software 

Readers with a hardware background are no doubt familiar with the 
concept of limiting the range of a signal, or "clipping" it. This is often 
accomplished using a nonlinear device such as a diode. In this article, 
we find the same concept used in the software which transforms a list 
of points making up an image so that it will fit on a display screen. 
Here, instead of an analog signal, the "signal" being limited is the 
numerical range of the coordinates being computed. The implemen- 
tation is different, but the concept is identical. . .CH

Table I: Homogeneous versus normalized 
representation of coordinates in two- 
dimensional space. The homogeneous repre- 
sentation of the coordinate pairs is a way of 
encoding the numbers in a general manner 
using the extra element h in the matrix row. 
The values of the coordinates are found by 
dividing h into each coordinate (expressed 
here as variable names, ie: "hx"; this does 
not mean "h times x"). The results are 
shown in the right side of the table. The 
extra column in the homogeneous form of 
the matrix is needed to make the matrix 
conformable with other matrices used for 
translation operations. 

infinity along the line from the origin 
through [a b] . This representation of points 
at infinity is completely consistent with all 
previous discussion and definitions of 
transformations. The only truly undefined 
homogeneous value in two-dimensional 
space is [0 0]. 

In transforming graphic elements, a 
problem may arise regarding the screen 
space boundaries. Portions of objects may 
fall outside the screen space after trans- 
formation. A similar situation may arise 
when objects are converted from problem 
space to screen space. It is therefore neces- 
sary to have a procedure for "clipping" the 
portions of objects outside the screen space 
so that the on-screen portion is accurately 
portrayed. The procedure described operates 
on the typical 4 sided rectangular screen. 

The screen may be defined by four 
inequalities: 

x > x„ x = leftmost x value 

x < x x = rightmost x value 
r r a 

V > Vl. V = bottom y value 

b b 

V < V y t = t°P V value 

The procedure operates on each line 
segment in the image and determines what 
portion, if any, lies in the screen space. 

The two endpoints of each line segment 
are classified as satisfying or not satisfying 
each of the four inequalities. Three specific

outside of the screen area, and the lines labeled (c) are partially within the 
screen area.

use the traditional method of similar triangles. A disadvantage of this method 
is that it requires multiplication, a relatively time consuming operation on a 
computer. 

cases may result from this endpoint coding: 

(a) Both endpoints satisfy all inequal- 
ities. 

(b) Both endpoints do not satisfy the 
same inequality. 

(c) Neither of the above. 

In case (a) the entire line lies within the 
screen space and is therefore displayed. In 
case (b) the entire line lies outside the screen 
space and is therefore not displayed. Case (c) 
requires further treatment. 

The visible portion (if any) of each case 
(c) line is determined by cutting it with 
every inequality line (screen boundary) 
which is violated by either endpoint. Each 
inequality or clipping boundary not satisfied 
will cut the line into two portions, visible 
and invisible. The portion remaining, if any, 
will be the line segment visible in the screen 
space. 

One approach to determining the point at 
which a line is cut by a boundary is derived 
from geometry (see figure 12a). The for- 
mulas for the left x boundary can be derived 
and the x p y^ and y t results follow in 
similar fashion. By similar triangles: 

V v v i- y o 

X c- X X 1~ X 
but 

The visible portion of the line is from (x g ,y ) 
to (x-j.y^. 

An alternative approach, the clipping 
divider, is more suitable for microprocessor 
implementation since it uses neither multi- 
plication nor division. It is actually a type of 
binary search. Using the example in figure 
12b, we define (x m ,y m ) as the midpoint of 
the line to be clipped. (x m ,y m ) is calculated 
as follows: 

X m = ( V X 1 ,/2 

v m = 'V v i ,/2 

(add and 1 bit shift) 
(add and 1 bit shift) 

If x m = x e , then y m is the y coordinate of 
the clipped endpoint and the process is 
completed. If x m violates the inequality, 
then replace (xQ,yg) with (x m ,y m ). Recalcu-

(x m ,y m ). Because of the shifting used to 
calculate (x m ,y m ), the process continues no

cutoff point of a line on the screen is to use a form of

word and the y coordinate will converge to 
the correct value. 

This clipping process completes the set of 
basic operations necessary to operate on 
two-dimensional information to produce 
graphic output. 

I hope readers will be encouraged to use 
these practical techniques in their experi- 
ments with computer graphics."

ture). 

This article presents an introduction to 
the use of APL for creating and manipulat- 
ing graphic images. The paper carries the 
reader through the steps of interactive 
graphic design using APL and IBM 5100 
APL Graphpak. The last section of this 
article, giving background information about 
APL and Graphpak, should be reviewed by 
the reader not familiar with either of these 
two topics. August 1977 BYTE is a useful 
source of APL information. For more de- 
tailed information about APL see the refer- 
ences listed at the end of this article. 

The initial checkout of the examples was 
done using an IBM 5100 in stand-alone 
mode. The results were drawn on an IBM 
5103 printer by modifying Graphpak to use 
output functions from the IBM 5100 Print 
Plot/APL Problem Solver Library. When the 
designs grew more complex, the IBM 5100 
was connected to an IBM System 370/ 
Model 168 and the code was executed there. 
The IBM System 370/Model 168 produced 
its output on a storage scope equipped with 
a hard copy unit. 

Developing Repetitive Patterns 

The first example follows a graphic de- 
signer through the development of a pleasing 
design for wrapping paper. Using a triangle 
as the basis for experimentation, the co- 
ordinates for a triangle centered at the ori- 
gin are derived as shown in figure 1 . A 
matrix, TRI, is then created to describe the 
triangle to the DRAW function: 

TRI+H 3pl,0.1 ,0, (COS 30). (-SIN 30), 0, (-COS 30), 
( -SIN 30) ,0 ,0,1 

For this example, TRI looks like:

To create patterns, translate the TRI matrix 
into the display window and draw it with 
the following APL function:

When executed on the IBM 5100, DESIGN1 
gives a very small triangle of the defined 
dimensions. It will be necessary to increase 
the size of the triangle since it is presently 
too small to be used in a design. The func- 
tion DESIGN2, shown in listing 1, is written 
to rotate the triangle 15 times and then 
translate the magnified pattern into the 
viewing area before drawing it. 

Note in line 4 of listing 1 that the initiali- 
zation of variable OUT is to be a matrix with 
no rows and three columns. This is done so 
that OUT has the proper shape when in line 
6 it is catenated with TRI2 (which has three 
columns). When DESIGN2 is executed on 
the IBM 5100 the result is: 

Even though the original (magnified) tri- 
angle is within the viewing window, the com- 
plete pattern is not. Instead of moving the 
whole pattern into the display window, the 
rotating triangles can be shrunk so they stay 
within each other. The result of experiment- 
ing with different shrinking factors (actually 
magnifications of less than 1.0) is the APL

function in listing 2. Execution of DESIGN3 
results in: 

To extend the design over a larger area of 
the plane, an upside-down version of the 
nested triangles is used. This upside-down 
design is obtained by rotating the original 
design 180° [it radians). The original and 
new patterns are then drawn side by side. 
This is accomplished by adding the following 
two lines at the end of program DESIGN3: 

[13] OWT2-H8 ROTATE OUT 

[1"»] DRAW 15 MAGNIFY (2*M?) TRANSLATE OUT2 

Execution of this program gives: 

This pattern is used to cover the plane. To 
do so, variable OUT is made into a matrix 
containing the description of both the 
original set of nested triangles and the upside- 
down nested triangles by replacing lines 12 
thru 14 with: 

[12] OUT2*TR TRANSLATE 180 ROTATE OUT 
[13] OUT+-OUT.111 0UT2 

Then, to draw the N by M tilings, two 
nested loops are added at the end of the 
APL function. These loops are incorporated 
in lines 14 thru 1 9 of the function DESIGN7, 
which is shown in its entirety in listing 3. 

Note that, in line 1 6 of listing 3, unneces- 
sary parentheses were used to make the 
meaning clearer. However, not enough 
parentheses were added to make the mean- 
ing completely unambiguous to readers not 
familiar with APL. For example, the expres-

TARBELL SOFTWARE 

Extensive & Inexpensive. 

TARBELL CASSETTE BASIC only $36.00 

Most features of ALTAI R Extended BASIC are inclu- 
ded PLUS these added features: 

• Assignment of I/O 

• Alphanumeric line labels 

• Unlimited length of strings 

• Unlimited length of variable names 

• Procedures with independent variables 

• Number system 10 digits BCD integer or floating 
point 

Included are commands unique to TARBELL CASSETTE 
BASIC which provide capabilities to: 

CP/M Disk Operating System 

The I/O section of this software has been modified 
to operate with the TARBELL Floppy Disk Interface in 
24K bytes of memory. Five commands permit listing of 
directory, typing contents of an ASCII file, renaming 
a file, erasing a file from disk, and saving memory on 
disk. Fourteen programs are included which are invoked 
like commands. Six source files are included for transfer- 
ring between TARBELL Cassette and disk, cold-start 
loading, Basic I/O system with drivers, and reformatting 
crashed diskettes. Documentation includes a listing of 
BIOS and instructions to patch CBIOS for your system. 
Price is $100 on CP/M diskette with documentation. 
(CP/M is a product of Digital Research). 

CP/M 1.4 Update Package 

A TARBELL Update Package for those now using 
CP/M 1.3 is now available on diskette. The Update 
Package adds new commands and the ability to access 
four disk drives, as well as 2 new CP/M manuals, TAR- 
BELL CP/M User's Guide and a new BIOS listing. 
Price: S50.00. 

• Initialize I/O channel • Assign a physical device to 
a logical device • Drop an I/O channel previously assign- 
ed «Save the BASIC interpreter and monitor or I/O 
routines on cassette 'Cause programs to be appended 
onto programs already in memory • Call a procedure 
and pass variables on the list • Cause interpreter to enter 
edit mode using 15 single character edit commands. 

Tarbell BASIC occupies 18K of RAM. Source is available 
on cassette, CP/M** Disk, and printout— all at reasonable 
prices. Price for TARBELL CASSETTE BASIC and com- 
plete documentation: $36.00. 

SPOOLER 

This 8080 program will save many hours of computing 

time. It intercepts all output to the list device, spools the 
output to a high-speed disk file, and directs the spooled 
data to a low-speed printer during unused cycle time while 
the CPU waits for transfer of data to and from the console. 
System throughput is greatly increased with the aid of 
SPOOLER. Output is never lost due to insufficient memory 
allocation. Fully compatible with the CP/M file system, 
SPOOLER permits parallel processing without hardware 
interrupt, and with minimal impact on other processes. 
Price: $50.00 (Copyright KLH Systems.)

BASIC'E Compiler 

Designed to work with CP/M Disk Operating System 
this software requires a total of 20K bytes of memory. 
Included are 26 compiler error messages and 23 run-time 
error messages. Disk files may be read, written or up- 
dated by using both sequential and random access. In- 
cluded are blocked and unblocked files. Price for com- 
piler and run-time monitor on diskette is $10.00. Manual 
is available separately for $5.00. (Public domain soft- 
ware by Gordon E. Eubanks, Jr.).

Upward compatible from BASIC-E, CBASIC is simi- 
lar but expanded to include several business oriented 
facilities, allowing decimal computations to 14 digits of 
precision, data formatting and PRINT USING state- 
ments. Statements allow access to disk files and disk 
file maintenance. Strings of characters may be read from 
the console to permit correct input line format to be 
checked before reading data. General programming fea- 
tures include variable names up to 31 characters, option- 
al line numbers, dynamic debugging tracers, and optional 
data output to printer. CBASIC on diskette and manual 
priced at $100. (Copyright Software Systems.) 

EMPL-an 8080 APL 

Especially suited to educational applications, EMPL 
is an adaptation of APL, using the ASCII character set. 
This 8K version occupies the first 5376 bytes of memory 
and operates in two modes. The Execution Mode per- 
mits all instructions to be executed immediately. The 
Definition Mode permits the user to enter functions. 
EMPL on Tarbell Cassette with manual is $15.00.

but in reality it needs no parentheses at all. 
Similarly, all the parentheses in 

are unnecessary. The values for TRX and 
TRY are computed in line 1 of listing 3. 
Variables N and M have been placed in 
the header line of the new APL function, 
and now become part of the calling syntax 
for it. Trying out the new function by enter- 
ing:

results in figure 2. 

It appears that a better design can be ob- 
tained by shifting every other row by half a 
triangle. This is accomplished by making use 
of the residue primitive function,

change is incorporated in line 16 of 
DE5IGN8: 

Tl6] LPJ:T , R*-(TRX*~1+(.2\I) + 2*J).I*TRY*(. 1*1) 

Also incorporated in line 16 is a shift of 
TRX units to the left for the entire drawing. 
The purpose of this shift is to avoid uncov- 
ered areas in the display window. 

When DESIGN8 was tested, it was clear 
that an appropriate selection of colors 
would add significantly to the design. With- 
out going into details, DESIGN8 was modi- 
fied so that it would create three different, 
overlapped pictures. Each could then be 
printed in a different color. The resulting 
design is shown in figure 3. 

Several other interesting designs can be 
obtained by slight modification of program 
DESIGN8. For example, instead of rotating 
the nested triangles to obtain an upside- 
down pattern, the sign of the values for the 
Y axis of the original set of embedded tri- 
angles can be reversed. This is equivalent to 
flipping the pattern over. The result is shown 
in figure 4. The APL function used to pro- 
duce the design for figure 4 is shown in list- 
ing 5. Additional designs can be created by 
overlapping patterns. 

Designing the Cover 

The areas involving graphics in which 
APL and Graphpak can be used are virtually 
unlimited. This second example follows a 
graphic designer who would like to create a 
design using a customer's trademark. He is 
told that the design should portray the 
virtues of the product. For the example 
consider the logo which appears on the cover 
of BYTE magazine.

tapes are furnished with the CT-1 synthesizer board. 

The optional CSR1 software package translates ASCII phonetic text strings to speech output. CSR1 is simple 
to use and is the easiest way to create new speech. CSR1 can also be called as a subroutine from user's code 
for applications involving program controlled voice output. 

The CSR1 phonetic rule system generates control parameters in the same form as used by CTEDIT. Thus, it is 
possible to further edit the output of the rule system, to achieve natural sounding speech output with minimum

The designer first creates a matrix called 
BYTE which contains the data required to 
draw the basic logo. This matrix was created 
by manually digitizing the logo. The logo 
can then be drawn, as in figure 5, by enter- 
ing the command: 

DRAW BYTE 

The intention is to create the design 
at a 90° angle. This way the logo can be 
moved along the X side of the display 
window (which is longer than the Y side). 
By reducing the size of the logo as it is 
moved, the customer's request for creating 
a feeling of "never-endingness" can be met.

ures that follow, the outline of the display

One way to move an object while simul-

Description of Graphpak 

This section covers common APL termi- 
nology, some Graphpak conventions, and a 
description of APL functions which are used 
in the paper. The discussion is, by necessity, 
oversimplified. It provides only enough in- 
formation to understand the paper. For 
more complete information on APL and 
Graphpak, consult the references. 

In APL, programs are called functions. 
Primitive functions are those which are part 
of the APL system, and are generally written 
as just one symbol or two overstruck sym- 
bols. One of the exceptions is the sine func- 
tion which is written: 

For example: 

A scalar is a single number, for example: 
3.1415. In general, a vector consists of sev- 
eral numbers, for example: 3 5 — 2.54. This 
definition of scalar and vector suffices as far 
as this paper is concerned. However, the ex- 
act definition of a scalar is "an object with 
dimensions," and for a vector, "an object of 
1 dimension." In fact, a vector can contain 
one or more elements or be empty. 

This paper is limited to the "Drawing 
Component" and parts of the "Descriptive 
Geometry Component" of Graphpak. For a 
description of the other components of 
Graphpak refer to the IBM 5100 APL 
Graphpak, Program Description/Operations 
Manual. 

The descriptive geometry functions of 
Graphpak are designed to perform geometric 
transformations on descriptions of three- 
dimensional objects, and to display projec- 
tions of the transformed objects on the dis- 
play window. The Graphpak display window 

is normally a rectangle in the XY plane with 
the coordinate origin at the left bottom cor- 
ner. In this paper the width (X direction) of 
the window is 100 units and the height (Y 
direction) is 76 units. Even though only two- 
dimensional objects are used here, the trans- 
formations take place in three-dimensional 
space. The Z dimension is assumed to come 
perpendicularly out of the page. 

To describe a series of lines to be drawn 
by Graphpak, a matrix with three columns is 
used. The first column is a binary vector. A 
1 tells the program to go to the (X,Y) posi- 
tion indicated by columns 2 and 3 without 
drawing a line. A means go to the indi- 
cated (X,Y) position while drawing a straight 
line. The function DRAW takes as its argu- 
ment a matrix that describes a series of lines 
and draws them. For example, if the variable 
BOX contains: 

10 

10 

10 10 

10 

then DRAW BOX gives: 

The desired values can be placed in BOX 
by entering 

SOX«-5 3pl000100 0101000 10 00 

where 

p 

(rho) is the reshape (primitive) function. The 

Table 1: Geometric transformation functions used in this article. 

Zi-D TRANSLATE X Yields Z, a matrix which describes the object X having been translated D[1] , and D[2] 
in the X and Y directions, respectively. 

If D is a scalar (a single number), it is assumed to be a translation in the X direction. 

Z+A ROTATE X Yields Z, a matrix which describes the object X having been rotated A[1], A [2], and 

A[3] degrees counter clockwise (looking in) about the X, Y, and Z axes, respectively, 
in that order. 

If A contains only one or two values, enough zeros are assumed to precede it to make 
its length equal to three. 

z<-P magnify x Yields Z, a matrix which describes the object Z having been magnified P[1] and P[2] 
times in the X and Y directions, respectively. If P is a scalar, the function extends that 
number to all coordinates.

left argument of rho specifies the shape to 
be given to the right argument. If two mat- 
rices describing two objects are to be put 
together, they can be catenated in the first 
dimension using 

For example, using the TRANSLATE func- 
tion (whose description follows): 

BOX2--10 10 TRANSLATE BOX 
DRAW B0X.H1B0X2 

gives: 

The geometric transformation functions 
used in this article are summarized in table 1 . 
In the descriptions given in table 1, TRANS- 
LATE and MAGNIFY are described as op- 
erating only in the X and Y directions. This 
is a simplification for the purpose of the 
paper. They are capable of performing three- 
dimensional manipulations. 

In addition to the Graphpak functions, 
the following APL functions are used here: 

V Z*A IF B 
[U Z-B/A 

7 Z+SIN X 
ill 2*lQjrx(O2)*360 

V Z-COS X 

[1] Z*20Ar*(02)f 360 

7 

The IF function is used to make the APL 
code used in the paper clearer to readers 
not familiar with APL. The SIN and COS 
functions are also used to make the code 
clearer to readers not familiar with APL; 
but in addition, they take an argument ex- 
pressed in degrees (the APL primitive trigo- 
nometric functions assume their arguments 
to be expressed in radians). 

the display window after rotating it 180° 
requires: 

DRAW 100 76 TRANSLATE 180 ROTATE BYTE 

Incorporating the above into the APL func- 
tion LOGOS1 (listing 6) to test the hypo- 
thesis produces figure 6. 

Next the designer tries to make a spiral 
by adding an X and Y translation to the 
shrinking logo using a sine function (in 
APL, sine is designated by: 

followed by an argument in radians) which 
decreases in magnitude. After some experi- 
mentation the function in listing 7 was 
found. 

Note the shift by 13 units in statement 5 
of listing 6. This was necessary because the 
translation using sines (statements 10 
thru 15) carried the design into negative 
X values. Execution of LOGOS2 results in 
the pattern of figure 7. 

There is still some empty space which 
could be filled with some type of interesting 
design. After experimenting with rotating a 
shrinking line, the function in listing 7 was 
developed. 

Lines 10, 11, and 12 of PICTURE1 create 
a symmetrical picture by reflecting the fig- 
ure generated about the Y axis. Line 13 de- 
termines the minimum translation required 
to get the figure within the display window. 
Execution of PICTURE1 results in figure 8. 
After rotating and making smaller drawings 
of the design created by PICTURE2, they 
are placed in the design created with logos. 
The finished product can be seen on the 
cover of this issue of BYTE. 

In summary, we have followed a graphic 
designer using APL and Graphpak through 
two problems and have seen the ease with 
which these software tools can be used for 
creating and manipulating graphic images."

Real-time 

interrupts 

add 

immense 

power 

to your 

computer. 

With a real -time calendar/clock 
your computer can extend its influence 
into the future — take action at any 
pre-programmed date and time. 

Imagine the possibilities! Program 
a daily printout of appointments. Pro- 
gram house temperature to rise at 6 a.m. 
every morning. Program games in 
which fast reaction time wins. Turn lights 
on and off to simulate occupancy of 
an empty house. In your business, print 
time and date on all computer output — 
hard copy or video display. Make your 
computer a freguency counter or time- 
interval meter. The possibilities are 
endless — especially if you use our Introl 
control system to send commands 
over existing wiring. 

We have superb calendar/clocks 
for Apple II and S- 100 computers. The 
Apple II clock keeps time for over 2 
years in 1 ms increments. Programming 
is simple because of the on-board ROM. 

The 100,000 Day Clock for S-100 
bus computers keeps time in 100 jLtsec 
increments. Programming is easy with 
most BASICs — especially our Introl 
BASIC. 

Both clocks feature crystal controlled 
accuracy and on-board battery back- 
up. Very simple to interface. Easy to set. 
And provided with interrupts that do 
not derail ongoing computer action 
when the clock commands action. 

Calendar/clock for Apple II is $179 
assembled and tested. For the S-100 
clock $219 assembled and tested. See 
them both at your local computer shop.

UCLA Computer Club 20th 
Anniversary Party 

The UCLA Computer Club will be 
holding a 20th anniversary party and 
reunion in October 1978. The tentative 
date is October 14. The intent is to have 
club members from every era (WDPC, 
Computing Facility, ARPA, CCN) 
present so that everybody has old friends 
to talk to. "Resistors" are also welcome. 

If you are a former UCLA Computer 
Club member, or you knew old members 
and would like to see them again, please 
send your name, address, and phone 
number to Joe Katz, Computer Club, 
3514 Boelter Hall, UCLA, Los Angeles 
CA 90024. A complete list will be sent 
to everyone who responds whether they 
decide to attend or not." 

A Worm Invades an Apple. . . 
(or, Computer versus Computer) 

Rumor has it that the underground 
technology of defrauding the telephone 
monopoly took a dubious step forward 
with the notorious "Capt Crunch's" 
latest escapade. Word is that the Federal 
prosecutors in the trial will introduce an 
Apple II computer in evidence as the 
instrument of the crime." 

More Notes from the Rumor Mill: 
Heath Software 

According to highly reliable sources, 
Heath is offering a slightly scaled down 

version of the DEC RT11 operating 
system (version 2C) as part of their H27 
dual full-size floppy disk kit. The soft- 
ware package, called the HT11, is being 
bundled with the floppy kit for a total 
price of approximately $1700, and will 
be available in October 1978. The RT1 1 
operating system (well-known in mini- 
computer circles) plus the RX01 dual 
floppy disk system would cost about 
$7000 if purchased from Digital Equip- 
ment Corporation (DEC). 

The only difference between the 
RT11 and HT11 packages is that the 
latter does not have the super macro- 
assembler or the foreground-background 
monitor (plus some additional utilities). 
It does have DEC's standard BASIC, 
however. Heath will also be offering 
DEC's standard FORTRAN package for 
$100. 

Finally, there is a possibility that 
Heath will be offering a UCSD Pascal 
package for $200 in the near future." 

Computerland's Second Birthday 

Computerland, currently the largest 
computer store chain, reports to us that 
they will be celebrating their second 
birthday on Saturday, September 23. 
Customers and friends are invited to 
local outlets of the chain. In our 
opinion, as patrons of the Nashua NH 
store, Computerland has to be one of 
the best planned and managed retail 
operations in this business. We trust 
that the Nashua store is typical of the 
other stores in this chain, which number 
over 40. . . .CH" 

Capacitor Value 

In Robin Moseley's article "A Low 
Cost Light Wand Amplifier" (May 1978 
BYTE, page 92), the value of capacitor 
C1 should be approximately 47 mF. 

Anyone using the optional peak 
detector to measure the amplifier output 
ould allow for the forward drop of the 

sh 

two detector diodes and adjust the 
circuit for a DC output voltage from the 
detector of approximately 0.5 V." 

Meetings in Bedford MA 

In July 1978 BYTE, we mentioned 
in the Clubs and Newsletters section 
that the New England Computer Society 
meets monthly at the Mitre Corp Cafe- 
teria, Bedford MA. However, we neg- 
lected to mention that they meet the 
first Wednesday of each month at

Totally Integrated, Entirely Self-Contained 

THE PET 

PERSONAL COMPUTER 

With technology so advanced, 

Concept so remarkable, 

Operation so utterly simple, 

Cost so incredibly low. 

The PET has given rise to a brand new era. 

The Age of the Personal Computer 

HIGH SPEED PRINTER 
ACCESSORY 

THE PET has become the standard for the personal com- 
puter industry. Consumer and business publications have 
lauded its discovery. POPULAR SCIENCE and PLAYBOY 
have given special tribute to the ' ' mind-boggling' ' PET. 
IN A LEAGUE WITH IBM, HP 
AND WANG MINICOMPUTERS 

THE PET is a minicomputer and should not be confused with 
game products that hook up to household T.V.'s. What sets 
it apart from other computers is price. While others cost 
from $11,000 to $20,000 and more, THE PET, with similar 
power, costs only $795.00. 

Features an IEEE-488 Bus -- like HP's mini and full size 
computers. This standard data and control channel permits 
direct connection to many peripherals. Over 1 20 pieces of 
compatible equipment such as counters, timers, spectrum 
analyzers, digital voltmeters and printer plotters, from HP, 
Phillips, Fluke, and Textronix, etc., are currently available. 
ROM Magazine, January 1978, writes. "THE PET comes 
out of the box, plugs into the wall, and is ready to use." It is 
equipped with a CRT video display with reverse and blink 
features, an alpha-numeric keyboard with complete graphics 
and a built-in standard cassette tape deck. 
THE PET has 8K bytes of RAM [user memory]. Optional 
equipment permits expansion to 32K. And, it has 1 4K bytes 
of ROM [program memory]. 

THE PET COMMUNICATES IN BASIC. 
THE EASIEST COMPUTER LANGUAGE 

if THE PET wants you to press a key, it will flash, "Press 
such and such", on the display. You speak back to it through 
its full size 73-key keyboard. 

EXTENSIVE CHARACTER 

ORIENTEDGRAPHICS 

The unit features a 9-inch, high resolution, 1 000 character 
CRT. Characters are arranged 40 columns by 25 lines on an 
8 x B matrix for superb graphics. 

WHAT ISTHE PET REALLY FOR? 

It is the single most important teaching device for any com- 
puter related subject. It will entertain the most sophisticated 
data application, or the simplest inquiry/response assign- 
ment. IN THE LAB it handles instrumentation, process 
monitoring, and more. A number of Fortune 500 companies 
have already made it an integral part of their lab and general 
office system. 

FEATURING AN IEEE-488 BUS 

As a BUSINESS TOOL it will; Maintain ledgers. Keep payroll 
records. Create P & L's. Control inventory. Store and 
analyze sales data. Draw bar graphs. Issue invoices. Hook up 
to on-line computer system. AT-HOME it will; Compute state 
and federal tax returns. Make heat and insulation analyses. 
Keep Christmas lists. Keep checkbook and finances up to 
date. A variety of games, from Black|ack to Galaxy, is cur- 
rently available.

A "Tiny" 
Pascal Compiler 

Part 1: The P-Code Interpreter 

Kin-Man Chung 
124 Scottswood Dr 
Urbana IL 61801 

Herbert Yuen 

POB 2591, Station A 

Champaign IL 61820 

Roughly speaking, a compiler is a pro- 
gram that translates the statements of a high 
level language (such as Pascal or FORTRAN) 
into a semantically equivalent program in 
some machine recognizable form (such as 
machine or assembly code). The former is 
usually referred to as the source program 
while the latter is called the object pro- 
gram. An interpreter, on the other hand, 
reads in the source program and starts 
exection directly, without producing an ob- 
ject program. 

There is little doubt that compilers and 
interpreters are a necessary part of any 
computer system. The reason most per- 
sonal computer systems do not have high 
level language compilers is not that there is 
no need for them. Compilers, being inherently 
more complex than interpreters, require 
more effort to write and more computer 
memory to run. The main advantage of a 
compiler over an interpreter is the relative 
speed. A compiled program typically runs 

About the Authors 

Kin-man Chung is currently a graduate student at the University of 
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Presently his equipment includes an 
Altair 8800 with 44 K bytes of memory, a North Star disk system, a 
100 cps impact matrix printer, and a Selectric terminal. His current 
interest in microcomputers is the development of an Interactive Pascal 
compiler for microcomputers, and a high resolution graphics system 
capable of animation. 

Herbert Yuen received a master of science degree in computer 
science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is 
presently working full-time as a research assistant at the university. 
His primary interest in microcomputers is software systems develop- 
ment. One of his future plans is to implement a small information 
retrieval system for a microcomputer. 

an order of magnitude faster than an equival- 
ent program executed interpretively. In fair- 
ness, it must be also pointed out that inter- 
preters are usually easier to use, and more 
suitable for an interactive environment. 

This series of articles is an attempt to 
describe how a compiler for a subset of 
Pascal was implemented on an 8080 com- 
puter system. It is not our intention to go 
into details for the reasons for the choice 
of the language. Pascal is widely recognized 
as superior to many other languages. For 
an overview of the language, readers are 
referred to August 1978 BYTE. The publi- 
cation, Pascal: User Manual and Report, by 
Kathleen Jensen and Niklaus Wirth 
(Springer- Verlag, 1974) should also be 
consulted as the authoritative source book 
on the language in its original form. 

This is not, of course, the first Pascal 
compiler ever written for microcomputers. 
However, instead of waiting for a Pascal 
compiler to be written for our particular 
processor, we decided to undertake the 
project ourselves. In this way, we can add or 
subtract features from the original Pascal to 
suit our needs and system capabilities, so 
that it can be easily integrated with other 
system software developed so far. 

2 Stage Compiler 

The compiler is divided into two stages: 
a p-compiler and a translator. Instead of 
having the compiler generate machine code 
directly, it generates code for a hypothetical 
machine, called the p-machine. These codes, 
called p-codes, are then converted into the 
target machine codes by the translator. 
Dividing the task of a compiler into two 
stages offers several advantages. The com- 
piler can be written abstractly, without com- 
mitting oneself to a particular machine and 
worrying about details of code generation 
and optimization. Such a compiler is said to 
be portable, meaning that it can be used on 
other computer systems with minimal start 
up effort. It is only at the last stage of code 
translation from the p-codes to actual ma- 
chine codes that we have to commit our- 
selves to a particular machine. 

Another advantage this method offers is 
greater flexibility when writing the com- 
piler. The compiler and the translator can be 
coded and debugged separately. The flexi- 
bility of such a compiler was apparent to us 
as we started to introduce more and more 
Pascal features into our original minimal 
subset. Seldom was it necessary for us to 
introduce new p-codes other than those 
originally specified. 

There is also one more reason for breaking

Figure I : Memory overlay structure of the modules of the compiler. The 
North Star DOS and BASIC start at hexadecimal 2000 and take up approxi- 
mately 14 K bytes of memory. The p-compiler is the largest BASIC program 
of the system; in its compressed form (void of all comments and blanks) it 
occupies 14 K bytes. It reads Pascal source programs created by the editor 
from disk files, and generates relocatable p-codes directly in memory. We use 
hexadecimal 0000 to 19FF for p-codes and find it adequate for Pascal source 
programs under about 300 lines in length. The smaller translator (9 K bytes) 
produces 8080 codes directly filled into memory. The origin of the codes 
can be specified. The run time routines (which total 1 K bytes of memory) 
are needed only when the translated 8080 codes are being executed. The 
interpreter is written in Pascal, compiled and translated. The BASIC inter- 
preter is no longer needed when it or any other Pascal program is being run. 

the compiler into two stages: most small 
computers do not have enough memory 
space to store the complete compiler. After 
the p-codes are generated, the p-compiler is 
no longer needed, and can be overlaid with 
the translator. Therefore the compiler and 
the translator can share the same memory 
locations. 

Actually we also use two other utility 
programs: a text editor and a p-code inter- 
preter. The editor is used to prepare the 
Pascal source programs. The interpreter is 
used to interpret the p-codes produced by 
the p-compiler. This provides another 
alternative for running the Pascal programs. 
Because it is equipped with various de- 
bugging aids, such as setting up breakpoints 
in p-codes and outputting values for vari- 
ables, debugging can be easily done. Only 
after a program is verified to be correct is 

the translator loaded, and 8080 code pro- 
duced. This allows easy development of 
the Pascal programs without sacrifying 
efficiency at run time. Figure 1 shows 
the overlay structure for the various mod- 
ules of the compiler. Figure 2 shows the 
logical flow during a program development. 
In this part of the series on our project, 
we will describe the general plan. The 
Pascal subset is defined using syntax dia- 
grams. A description of the p-machine and 
its codes are also given. We will discuss the 
p-compiler, translator and runtime routines 
in the following parts. 

Bootstrap Compiler 

How does one introduce a new language 
into a computer system with limited com- 
puter resources? By computer resources we 
mean not only the computer hardware like 
memory and peripherals, but also software 
tools. We have learned from experience not 
to attempt programs with the complexity 
of a compiler in machine or assembly lan- 
guage. This left us with BASIC. Although 
it is not the most desirable language to 
write a compiler with, it turned out to be 
adequate. Some careful thought is needed, 
of course, to handle recursive subroutine 
calls from BASIC, a feature central to our 
compiler writing. 

The alternative to BASIC is to go to a 
commercial computer and write the whole 
or part of the compiler in an appropriate

MEET THE 

ECONORAM 
FAMILY . . . 

These static memory kits deliver 
outstanding performance at prices 
even the dynamics can't match. What 
others consider "extras" we consider 
necessities, such as buffering on all 
lines, reliable DMA, sockets, gold- 
plated card fingers . . . and all the 
other signs of quality that make up an 
Econoram. 

More good news: Our memory kits 
(except Econoram IT") are now 
"Unkits". All sockets and bypass caps 
are pre-soldered into place, turning 
an otherwise tedious assembly job in- 
to a pleasurable, one evening project. 

We want to be your memory sup- 
plier: and that means offering a 
superior product at the lowest possi- 
ble price.

desirable by pre-soldering all 11 edge connectors 
in place to take the tedium out of assembly. In- 
cludes our much-copied active termination cir- 
cuitry that takes the noise, glitches, ringing, and

would be very inefficient and slow. But this 
actually would not matter, since it would 
only be used as a bootstrap compiler. The 
concept of bootstrapping should be familiar 
to most personal computer owners. We 
usually use it when initially starting up 
our computers. After turning on the power, 
a bootstrap loader is first loaded into the 
computer (either manually or through the 
use of read only memory). This bootstrap 
loader is then used to load the loader, which 
in turn loads the monitor into memory. The 
bootstrap loader is a smaller version of the 
loader; it is just big enough to load the main 
loader and not adequate to be a general 
purpose loader. 

The same idea can be applied to com- 
piler writing. A compiler for a small subset 
of a language is first written. This subset 
should be big enough so that a compiler for 
a bigger subset of the same language can be 
written in it. The larger compiler is then 
written and compiled, using the first com- 
piler. Next, a compiler for a still bigger sub- 
set of the same language can then be written 
and compiled, using the second compiler, 
and so on until a compiler for the complete 
language is produced. In actual practice, no 
more than three stages are used. It does not 
matter if the first compiler is very inefficient. 
The idea is to get a working, albeit primitive 

and inefficient, compiler with minimum 
starting effort. 

Pascal Subset Syntax 

The syntax of Pascal can be described 
precisely by using a notation usually called 
Backus-Naur form (BNF). This is a collec- 
tion of rules for the grammar of the lan- 
guage. Instead of dealing with Backus-Naur 
form directly, we use an equivalent but more 
understandable notation: the syntax dia- 
grams. Figure 3 describes the syntax of the 
Pascal subset we are interested in. 

In the syntax diagram, the square boxes 
are called nonterminal symbols, while the 
ovals are called terminal symbols. Terminal 
symbols are the basic building units of the 
language and require no further expansion. 
In our case, the names that represent the 
terminals are also their textual representa- 
tions in the language. The nonterminal sym- 
bols in the syntax diagrams can be expanded 
using rules specified in another syntax dia- 
gram, and there is a syntax diagram for each 
nonterminal symbol in the syntax diagram. 
A branch in the diagram represents options 
allowable by the grammar. When all non- 
terminal symbols are eliminated by ex- 
pansion in this fashion, we would have a 
valid program. We start off a compilation 
with the nonterminal program. Looking at 

SAVE THE WHALE 

The world's best computer may be inside a Sperm Whale's head. 

The Sperm Whale has the largest brain of any creature that has ever existed 
on our planet. The brain of this 18-meter marine mammal weighs up to 9 kilograms. 
It uses echo-location to find giant squid at ocean depths of over 1,000 meters. 
More than 13,000 sperm whales are scheduled to be slaughtered this year 
by agreement of the International Whaling Commission.

non-profit education and conservation organization dedicated 
to seeking the abolition of all whale killing. Any 
concerned citizen can help our efforts by sending

Figure 3: Syntax diagrams of the Pascal subset. For the syntax diagrams of the full Pascal set 
refer to the book by Kathleen Jensen and Niklaus Wirth, entitled Pascal: User Manual and 
Report. These diagrams totally define the subset of the language that we are using. 

the syntax diagram we see that a program 
is a block followed by a period (.). Looking 
at the syntax diagram for block, we notice 
that it can have an optional declaration part 
followed by the main body which begins 
with the string begin, followed by any 
number of the nonterminal symbols, state- 
ment, separated by semicolons (;), and then 
the string end. The statement block can be 
further expanded by the syntax diagram for 
statement, and so on. 

The reason we go through the details 
here is because it is important to precisely 
describe the features we want to include in 
our language before starting to write the 
compiler. It is the first step towards writing 
the compiler. These syntax diagrams will 
later become flowcharts for the syntax 
analyzer of the compiler. 

Readers familiar with Pascal will no 
doubt notice several important features 
missing from our subset. There is no GOTO 
statement. The only data type we have is 
integer and integer array of one dimension. 
Also missing from the subset is the structured 

data type, pointer type, user defined type, 
and file type. A less obvious omission is 
passing the parameter of a procedure by 
address; the parameters are passed by value 
only. Aside from the fact that these features 
are difficult to implement, they are not 
indispensable in our bootstrap process. Of 
course, features like user defined type and 
structured type are some of the unique fea- 
tures of Pascal, and should not be omitted in 
the long run. But we feel that they can be 
added later. 

We have also included some trivial but 
nevertheless useful enhancements to the 
language, which we hope do not deviate 
from the standard too much. One is the 
addition of the optional clause else to the 
case statement which provides an exit path 
if the value of the variable does not fall 
into any of the case labels. Another is the 
inclusion of format controls in the read and 
write statements. Following an expression 
in a write statement, a pound sign, #, indi- 
cates numeric form and a percent sign, %, 
indicates hexadecimal format. If there is no 

64 

September 1978 ©BYTE Publications Inc 

format control, a character whose ASCII 
code equals the expression is output. Also a 
hexadecimal constant is prefixed by %. This 
allows processing of hexadecimal numbers 
without conversion by the user. 

To allow interfacing Pascal programs with 
assembly programs, a facility is provided to 
read or write a byte from or to absolute 
memory locations. The array mem is a re- 
served array name that is used to do this.

List price was about 100,000 Yen, which 
means it will sell discount for about 
80,000+ Yen. Like the PC1200 (already

of read only memory on chip. Sharp 
earlier released the EL-6000, a child's

Mitsubishi had a 4 bit microprocessor

Panafacom had the C15, a BASIC,

NEC's BASIC station, a do it yourself

plus separate alphanumeric keyboard, 
video (TV) and cassette interfaces, runs 
a 4 K Tiny BASIC with peek, poke and

ard (sin, log, etc) math routines plus up 
to 18 character alphanumeric names, is

RARE CHASSIS? 

I want to thank Dan Fylstra for his 
article in the May 1978 BYTE, page 22, 
"Convert Your TV Set to a Video 
Monitor." It was clearly written and well 
illustrated. I was about to purchase a 
TRS-80 from Radio Shack and his article 
convinced me that I should buy a 
Hitachi TV and a Pickles and Trout con- 
verter. Thus 1 would have both a com- 
puter display and a portable TV. 

But alas! I live in Dallas TX. And in 
Dallas TX not one store that I called 
that handles Hitachi TVs has the models 
with the SX chassis! What's more, the 
Hitachi district offices listed in the yel- 
low pages have closed and I was given 
a phone number in Atlanta GA! Now I 
could have called long distance to 
Atlanta, but I wasn't interested in order- 
ing a TV from Atlanta orTokyo. Chances 
are the model has been discontinued 
anyway. 

Pickles and Trout had a good idea, 
but does a 12 inch TV exist that is not 
AC/DC? A TV chassis with a transformer 

type power supply does allow an easier 
hookup than does a "hot" chassis. But 
if one is not generally available, there 
is a market for an AC/DC converter that 
is as specific as the Pickles and Trout 
unit. 

As for me, I ordered the TRS-80 
complete with display cathode ray tube 
(CRT). After all, they toss in the cassette 
recorder if you buy the whole thing! But 
I do hope the SX chassis does exist else- 
where so others can use Mr Fylstra's 
article.

NEEDED: SATELLITE RECEIVER 
WITH IMAGING CAPABILITY 

I would be so grateful for some 
information concerning satellite receiv- 
ing stations using computers for data 
storage and video display. (I am inter- 
ested in observing cloud cover.) 

If there has been any article in your 
publication (or any other, for that 
matter) which deals with this subject I 
would be so pleased to know about it. 
Perhaps someone has developed such a 
station using their microcomputer, and 
who would be generous enough to share 
their knowledge with others as an 
article. 

Thank you for any help you can 
provide.

We've not published such an article 
to date, but it would make an excellent 
topic for the homebrewer. For output 
one could use one of the new electro- 
static printers with graphic capability 
which retail for about $800 -- or simply 
display the images on your video outputs

DREAMING . . . 

I am 1 214 years old, and plan to get a 
computer system up and running in the 
near future. The mainframe I have se- 
lected is the Heathkit H1 1 , incorporating 
the DEC LSI-11 processor. I chose this 
mainframe because of the processor em- 
ployed and the low price, only $1295. 
This price is offset by a few disadvan- 
tages, such as its bus, with only six 
slots, and the fact that its price is only 
relatively low (at this time I have only 
$724.08). But, like any other problems 
in this world, these can be solved. I can 
fix the bus problem by simply buying 
an expansion interface from DEC, but 
this makes the second problem worse 
yet. And, unlike other problems, buying 
more of what you need (money) simply 
defeats itself in its purpose. So I just 
have to save. (And save, and save. . . .) 

However, by the time I finally do

have the money for it, something bigger 
and better (and slightly more expensive) 
will have appeared on the horizon. I will 
probably continue at this pace until I am 
a millionaire at 21. At this point, of 
course, I will buy a large computer from 
DEC or some other company and charge 
people to timeshare on it. Only problem 
is, I don't know where I am going to get 
the million dollars in the first place. 
It's nice dreaming, though, and my 
dreaming is going to get me somewhere 
in this world. (I hope so, anyway!)

KUDOS FOR KENT 

It seems E W Kent ("The Brains of 
Men and Machines," January through 
April 1978 BYTE) has violated Higher 
Education Law #1: Never explain com- 
plex issues in understandable terms. 
Kent must be aware of the ramifications 
of violating this most basic principle of 
higher education, the most significant 
being the release of usable information 
to lay people who might understand it 
and use it. 

Kent has produced a classic, and has 
given the computer scientist a game plan 
for the creation of the first real cyber- 
netic system. He has also given the

ASSUMED FLOW 
OF EXECUTION 

Figure I : The process block is the "black box" of programming: it is entered 
by a single input path, does some arbitrary operations upon data, and is 
exited by a single output path. The "arbitrary operations" can be as simple 
as one step in an arithmetic calculation, or as complex as a compilation of a 
program — it all depends on the point of view taken. 

Some Words About Program Structure 

Albert D Hearn 
98 SW 13th Av 
Boca Raton FL 33432 

Microprocessor programming, at this 
point in time, is a black art. Once you have 
learned the basic instruction set, you're on 
your own. Some people get the knack of 
this mysterious task fairly quickly, and 
some do not. Those who do well seem to 
have developed some sort of system for 
going about it. The point is that an or- 
ganized, systematic approach is required 
if there is any hope for continued program- 
ming success. The purpose of this article 
is to describe to you one such method 
which has become very popular with pro- 
grammers of all types, using all kinds of 
computers from micros to the giants. 

Concept 

What we're looking for is simplicity in 
the writing of programs. This is usually 
achieved if the program can be reduced 
to a collection of basic components which 
fit together in very well-defined ways. This 
is the concept behind structured program- 
ming. 

Any program can be considered to have 
only two basic building blocks. One is the 

process block shown in figure 1. It simply 
performs some defined function, or proc- 
ess. It might represent a simple function 
requiring only a few, maybe only one, in- 
structions in the program, or a much larger 
function requiring many instructions. What- 
ever it does, it has one input and one output. 

The second basic block is the decision 
block shown in figure 2. This elementary 
capability of any computer is that which 
gives it all its power and flexibility. It is 
the ability to alter the path taken by the 
program based upon the value of some 
parameter or condition which can be tested 
by certain instruction types. For example, 
two numbers can be compared and a test for 
equality used to decide which of two pro- 
gram paths will be taken as a result. 

These two fundamental building blocks 
will now be used in the construction of a 
set of basic program structures with which 
any other program can be built. The three 
general structures are called sequence, if- 
then-else and loop. Variations of these will 
be examined, as well as combinations which 
can be used to build more complex functions. 

ASSUMED FLOW 
OF EXECUTION 

Figure 2: The decision block is a simpler concept than the process block, in 
the sense that the amount of computation required rarely approaches the 
generality of an "arbitrary process. " A decision block has one input and, 
depending upon a binary condition, takes one of two output paths. In this 
figure, the names "true," "then" and "yes" denote one possible path; the 
names "false," "else" and "no" describe the other possible path. In pro- 
gramming languages, the "then" or "else" terminology for the two paths 
is frequently built into the language design; the other terms are frequently 
seen in flowchart representations of programs. 

TWO OUTPUT PATHS 
("UNSTRUCTURED") 

68 September 1978 © BYTE Publications Inc 

Remember: In structured programming, everything 
is a process block, with one input path and one 

output path. 

Editor's Note: 

BYTE Flowchart Flow Conventions 

As an "ideal" standard, flowcharts 
in BYTE use a direction of flow con- 
vention as follows: 

Default flow: Vertical flow is 
from the top of a diagram toward 
the bottom, and horizontal flow 
is from the left of a diagram to- 
wards the right, unless explicit 
flow is used. Thus: 

IMPLIED FLOW 
SHOWN BY ARROWS 

Explicit flow: Vertical flow 
upward or horizontal flow left- 
ward in a drawing is shown with 
an explicit arrow at the end of the 
flow path, thus: 

EXPLICIT FLOW 
ARROW AT END 
OF PATH WITH 
HORIZONTAL FLOW 
TO LEFT OR 
VERTICAL PATH 
UPWARD 

Merged flow: When two or three 
paths of flow merge, the two or 
three inputs to the joint path have 
arrows noted:

Figure 3: The sequence structure is the simplest programming structure. 
It can be viewed from the outside as the equivalent of a process block, but 
upon close examination it is found to contain one or more process blocks. 

Basic Structures 

The simplest of the program structures, 
shown in figure 3, is the sequence structure, 
which is composed of one or more process 
blocks strung together serially. Like the 
process block from which it is built, the 
sequence structure has only one input path 
and one output path. In fact, you will soon 
see that one of the rules that we want all 
structures to conform to is that they have a 
single input path and output path. Further- 
more, an entire program, which can be rep- 
resented by one large process block, should 
also conform to this rule. 

The next structure is the if-then-else 
structure, shown in figure 4. It consists of 
a decision block and two process blocks. 
Only one of the process blocks is executed 
for any single pass through the structure. 
The result of the test or comparison repre- 
sented by the decision block determines 
which process block is chosen. Notice that

Figure 4: The if-then-else structure is composed of a decision block and two 
process blocks. The process blocks may themselves be viewed as any form of 
structure with a single input and a single output path, and thus might in fact 
be sequence structures, if-then-else structures, etc. 

regardless of which path is taken there is 
one common exit path from the if-then-else 
structure. This is required to maintain our 
single exit philosophy. 

An if-then-else structure does exactly 
what it says: If a condition is true, then 
take a specified action, else take a specified 
alternate action. However, there are times 
when only one action is required in only 
one of the paths. No action is necessary 
in the other path. In an actual flow dia- 
gram, this is of course shown by drawing 
a flow line in place of one or the other 
process block of the if-then-else structure 
since the most trivial process is simply 
going to the next process without doing 
anything. Note however that only one of the 
process blocks can be made up of this 
simplest case of "do nothing" since if both 
process blocks were eliminated from the 
if-then-else structure, the net effect would 
be to "do nothing" all the time whether 
or not the condition was true or false. 

The if part of an if-then-else structure is 
simply any program instruction which can 
perform a test and take one of two paths 
depending upon the outcome. In an as- 
sembly language, this is usually a condi- 
tional jump or a branch instruction based 
upon the outcome of some comparison, 
arithmetic operation or other operation 
which affects processor status flags used in 
such branches and jumps. The branching 
instruction specifies the destination address 
of the beginning of one path. Whether it is 
the then or the else leg is arbitrarily defined, 
and the next sequential instruction is as- 
sumed to begin the opposite path. 

Some higher level languages like BASIC 
have ready-made if-then-else instructions. 
BASIC has IF and THEN; ELSE is implied. 
The following shows how an if-then-else 
would look in BASIC: 

IF X=YTHEN 10 

GOTO 15 

FALSE PART 

10 

I TRU 

EPART 

15 END 

In this example, the else code immediately 
follows the IF instruction. The GOTO 15 
ends the else path and causes the program 
to branch to the common exit point at 
line 15. The then path starts at line 10 and 
ends at line 15. [BASIC is considered to be 
an "unstructured" language because of 
the need for an explicit GOTO following

Figure 5: The do-until structure is a looping form whose purpose is to exe-

If you use assembly language in your 
programming, and your assembler has a 
macroinstruction capability, then you can 
write your own if -then-else macros. It is 
beyond the scope of this article to describe 
how this is done, but it isn't very difficult. 

If you use assembly language and don't 
have facilities for writing macros, then you 
can simulate the function of the macro- 
assembler in order to gain the advantages 
of structured programming. Simply sit 
down and write yourself a set of standard 
if-then-else structures. Take the five or 
six most common decision types (equal, 
not equal, zero, greater than, etc) and write

Figure 6: The do-while structure is a looping form whose purpose is to exe- 
cute a given process block only If the "while condition" is true. Thus it can 
execute the process block zero times if the condition is false initially, or an 
arbitrary number of times so long as the condition remains true during re- 
peated execution of the process block. 

skeleton programs for each. Leave blanks 
for the actual condition to be tested, and 
leave space for the actual code which will 
perform the then and else functions. Later, 
when you need an if-then-else while writing 
a program, you can draw upon your set of 
prewritten structures. Not only does this 
eliminate your having to invent similar pro- 
gram sequences over and over again, but it 
also prevents many bugs and greatly eases 
the effort you have to put into program 
writing. 

The last basic structure is the loop, 
which provides a means of repeating a se- 
quence of instructions until some stop 
condition is found to exist. There are two 
kinds of loop structures: do-until and 
do-whlle. 

A do-until structure, shown in figure 5, 
performs the function in the process block 
at least once. After that, a test is done to 
determine if the condition for stopping the 
process looping has been found true. As 
long as the condition is not true, the loop- 
ing continues. When it becomes true the 
looping ends and the exit path is taken. 
This type of structure can be used, for 
example, when you need to search a table of 
values, looking for a particular value. If you 
know that the table will always contain a 
matching entry, the program routine need 
not be more complicated by logic to detect 
end-of-table before a matching value is 
found. Notice that the first table entry is 
always examined before the decision is made 
to continue (this is because the ending 
condition decision is based upon the value 
of that entry). 

The second type of loop is the do-while, 
shown in figure 6. The difference between 
this and the do-until structure is that the 
test is done before the process block is 
executed. In many cases there is not a lot 
of significance to this difference because 
both types of structures can do the same 
jobs. 

In specific situations you will find that 
one form will usually be better suited or 
more convenient than the other. The pri- 
mary difference to remember is that the 
do-until form always executes the process 
block at least once whether or not the 
until condition is true, and that the do- 
while may not execute the process at all if 
the while condition is false at the time of 
the first test. Experience will best teach 
you which to use in the various situations. 

A variation of the loop structures of 
either form might be considered, the endless 
loop or do-forever. This form of loop occurs 
when the while or until condition is never 
changed to allow execution of the output

path of the structure. Intentional endless 
loops are occasionally used, as in the low 
level programming trick of hanging up 
execution in a tight loop to flag errors, 
or the quite legitimate endless loops which 
form the outer level of control of a typical 
executive or monitor program. But for most 
programming purposes, an endless loop is a 
bug or error in the program. 

An Example 

Now using the basic structures, we can 
construct a program of any size and com- 
plexity by combining and nesting in any 
manner as long as some fundamental rules 
are adhered to: 

• The program as a process should have 
only one input path and one output 
path. 

• Structures within the program can 
be nested but each structure must be 
totally contained within the structure 
in which it is being nested (this will be 
illustrated later). 

• There should be no branching unless 
it is part of a structure (for example, 
the GOTOs required in languages like 
BASIC). 

• Refrain from attempting to optimize 
the program by violating the above 
rules. There is a right time for this 
later. 

Before we look at an example of struc- 
turing a program, let's first look at how 
nesting of basic structures works. Figure 7 
shows a flowchart of a program which, 

Figure 7: The various types of structures can be nested by noting that any 
place where a process block is indicated, a more complex structure can be 
used since it, too, only has one input path and one output path of execution. 
Thus, for example, this flowchart shows nesting of a process Q block and an 
if-then-else structure as the else part of the if-then-else structure with condi- 
tion X=Y?. This second it-then-else in turn has a third if-then-else as part of 
its else part. The colored outlines show the nesting of one structure within 
another. 

Figure 8: An unstructured 
flowchart performs an end- 
less process as might be 
implemented in an auto- 
mobile interlock. This is a 
complete and viable solu- 
tion of the problem, but it 
involves numerous branch- 
ing operations performed 
in an uncontrolled (GO I O) 
fashion.

overall, could be represented by a single 
if-then-else. But when it is looked at in more 
detail, the else leg contains another if-then- 
else as part of the instruction sequence 
there; the else leg of that structure con- 
tains yet another if-then-else. The heavy 
outlines show that each of the nested struc- 
tures are totally enclosed by their parent 
structures; there is no overlap. A BASIC- 
like program to perform the function shown 
in figure 9 appears as listing 1. Again, I 
use outlines to illustrate that each structure 
is embedded in its entirety within another 
higher level structure. Notice that I have 
used indentation of lines to increase the 
readability of the program. Each separate 
structure should be at a different level of 
indentation than its parent.

Figure 9: Taking the algorithm of figure 8 and casting it into a standardized, structured pro- 
gramming form eliminates all GOTO operations in languages with a complete if-then-else 
structure, and in languages like BASIC, reduces use of GOTO operations to standardized struc- 
tures. In this flowchart, we've positioned all the blocks to emphasize the nesting of structure. 
One of the primary reasons for the emphasis on structured programming is one of communica- 
tions of ideas to other programmers (or the originating programmer at a later date). The claim 
is made that a flowchart like this one, and its equivalent representation in listing 2, provide a 
standardized way of communicating algorithms which makes the listing or chart easier to under- 
stand and read.

Listing 2: A B ASIC-like 
application program for 
activating a buzzer of an 
automobile given several 
conditions. A subroutine 
BUZZ is indicated (by a 
call with the keyword 
GOSUB) to actually sound 
a noise during the loop. 
In this B ASIC-like repre- 
sentation, several liberties 
with syntax have been 
taken. 

Let's look now at an example of a simple 
program and show how a structured version 
might differ from an unstructured version. 

The program is one which might be part 
of a future automobile computer control 
system using a microprocessor. Its purpose 
is to trigger a buzzer if the ignition key is 
left in the lock when the left front door is 
opened, or if the headlights are left on 
when the key is not in the lock. A delay is 
performed before conditions are checked 
again. 

The flowchart in figure 8 shows how we 
might have drawn it without attempting to 
apply any of the principles of structured 
programming. Now, look at figure 9 which 
shows the structured version. Both forms 
of the program do the same function, but 
the structured form is clearly more straight- 
forward and easier to write code from. 

Basically, a number of things happened 
to the flowchart when it was structured. 
First, all the branches (or GOTOs) became 
forward branches except those in loop 
structures. This allows for reading the chart 
from top to bottom in an orderly way. 
Secondly, each decision block and process 
block has been put into a proper structure 
and nested totally within its parent struc- 
ture. Thirdly, every structure regardless 
of its place in the overall program has only 
one input and one output. 

One thing has happened that might ap- 
pear to be a little strange to you. The se- 
quence structure which performs the buzzer 
function appears twice now, where it only 
appeared once before. This is necessary in 
order to keep the structure clean. Remem-

ber, you cannot simply branch into the 
other buzzer block because those two 
structures would then overlap. The inef- 
ficiency implied by the double appearance 
of that block might bother you, but it will 
probably turn out that the block will be 
written as a subroutine and the only in- 
efficiency will be an extra call instruction. 

Listing 2 is a BASIC-like program for the 
structured flowchart. (Here "BASIC-like" 
means using the syntax of BASIC but 
allowing variable names to be many char- 
acters in length for purposes of illustrating 
their meaning.) I have not attempted to 
make the program complete and have taken 
some liberties in order to illustrate my 
points. 

A few words of explanation are in order. 
First, the instructions at lines 3, 4 and 5 
represent a do-until structure which is used 
to implement a delay by simply increment- 
ing a counter (X) until it reaches a large 
value. The name BUZZ represents the line 
number of a subroutine (not shown) which 
activates an electronic buzzer in the car's 
dash. 

Now is the time to go back and look at 
the program to make it more efficient in 
its operation or in the amount of memory 
required. This should be done only if it is 
absolutely necessary. If it is necessary, try 
to maintain the structuring to the extent 
that it doesn't destroy the clarity of the 
program or increase its complexity. In our 
example program, notice that there are 
three CONTINUE instructions at lines 
13, 14 and 15 leading to a GOTO at line 
16. The speed of the routine can be im- 
proved and the memory requirements can 
be reduced by eliminating the CONTINUES 
and changing any instruction which refer- 
ences any of them to go to line 16. Alter- 
natively, you could change each of those 
references to go directly to line 1 although 
you would be seriously interfering with the 
intent of structuring. 

In conclusion, I invite you to try the 
techniques described in this article when you 
write your next program. If you have done 
it any other way before, it takes a little 
getting used to, but I think you will ulti- 
mately agree that it has a lot to offer. 
Hopefully, you will see the benefits in the 
form of less time spent getting your pro- 
gram designed, written and debugged. In 
short, I believe that it can help make pro- 
gramming even more enjoyable."

BYTE Publications, Inc. is proud to announce the 
creation of its new Book Division, which publishes 
books of interest to computer people. Readers 
will find a wide range of topics published as BYTE 
Books, including new material as well as collec- 
tions of reprints of the best BYTE magazine arti- 
cles. Users of small computers will find PAPER- 
BYTE™ Books to be complete descriptions of 
useful system software including detailed user 
documentation, source listings where possible, 
and the PAPERBYTE™ bar code representation 
of executable code. 

To keep the cost reasonable and available to the 
greatest number of readers, the books will be 
paperback editions in the 8-1/2 x 11" format. You 
may purchase the initial selections directly from 
BYTE via mail order or from your favorite com- 
puter store or book distributor. 
PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUES is a new series 
of BYTE BOOKS concerned with the art and 
science of computer programming. It is a collec- 
tion of the best articles from BYTE magazine 
and new material collected just for this series. 
The book provides the personal computer user 
with background information to write and main- 
tain programs effectively. 

The first book in the Programming Technique 
series is entitled PROGRAM DESIGN. It dis- 
cusses in detail the theory of program design. 
The purpose of the book is to provide the per- 
sonal computer user with the techniques needed 
to design efficient, effective, maintainable pro- 
grams. Included is information concerning struc- 
tured program design, modular programming 
techniques, program logic design, and examples 
of some of the more common traps the casual 
as well as the experienced programmer may 
fall into. In addition, details on various aspects 
of the actual program functions, such as hashed 
tables and binary tree processing, are included.

Price: $6.00 
Publication: Fall 1978 

In SIMULATION, the second book of the series, 
are articles dealing with various aspects of spe- 
cific types of simulation. Both theoretical and 
practical applications are included. Particularly 
stressed is simulation of motion, including wave 
motion and flying objects. The realm of artificial 
intelligence is explored, along with simulating 
robot motion with the microcomputer. Finally, 
tips on how to simulate electronic circuits on the 
computer are detailed.

Price: $6.00 
Publication: Fall 1978 

The third book is NUMBERS IN THEORY AND 
PRACTICE. This book includes information of 
immense value to both the novice and the expe- 
rienced personal computerist. The mechanics 
of the binary system are discussed, including 
division and multiplication, as well as the places 
to look for numerical error in programs. Floating 
point numbers, what they are and how to use 
them, are covered. There are also sections on 
numerical methods (functions, approximations, 
statistics), Boolean math, and several different 
approaches on how to obtain random numbers.

The fourth book so far scheduled in this series 
is called BITS AND PIECES. The articles col- 
lected for this book are mostly unrelated and do 
not neatly fit into the topics of the previous three 
books, but still have a lotto do with programming 
techniques. Areas such as multiprogramming 
and interactive computing with the personal 
computer are discussed, as well as stacks, sort- 
ing, Polish notation, and program optimization. 
This is by far the most general book of the series.

RA6800ML: AN M6800 RELOCATABLE 
MACRO ASSEMBLER is a two pass assembler 
for the Motorola 6800 microprocessor. It is de- 
signed to run on a minimum system of 16 K bytes 
of memory, a system console (such as a Teletype 
terminal), a system monitor (such as Motorola 
MIKBGG read only memory program or the 
ICOM Floppy Disk Operating System), and some 
form of mass file storage (dual cassette recorders 
or a floppy disk). 

The Assembler can produce a program listing, 
a sorted Symbol Table listing and relocatable 
object code. The object code is loaded and linked 
with other assembled modules using the Linking 
Loader LINK68. (Refer to PAPERBYTE™ publi- 
cation LINK68: AN M6800 LINKING LOADER 
for details.) 

There is a complete description of the 6800 
Assembly language and its components, includ- 
ing outlines of the instruction and address for- 
mats, pseudo instructions and macro facilities. 
Each major routine of the Assembler is described 
in detail, complete with flow charts and a cross 
reference showing all calling and called-by rou- 
tines, pointers, flags, and temporary variables. 

In addition, details on interfacing and using the 
Assembler, error messages generated by the 
Assembler, the Assembler and sample IO driver 
source code listings, and PAPERBYTE™ bar code 
representation of the Assembler's relocatable 
object file are all included. 

This book provides the necessary background 
for coding programs in the 6800 assembly lan- 
guage, and for understanding the innermost 
operations of the Assembler.

LINK68: AN M6800 LINKING LOADER is a 

one pass linking loader which allows separately 
translated relocatable object modules to be loaded 
and linked together to form a single executable 
load module, and to relocate modules in memory. 
It produces a load map and a load module in 
Motorola MIKBGG loader format. The linking 
Loader requires 2 K bytes of memory, a system 
console (such as a Teletype terminal), a system 
monitor (for instance, Motorola MIKBGG read 
only memory program or the ICOM Floppy Disk 
Operating System), and some form of mass file 
storage (dual cassette recorders or a floppy disk). 

It was the express purpose of the authors of this 
book to provide everything necessary for the 
user to easily learn about the system. In addition 
to the source code and PAPERBYTE™ bar code 
listings, there is a detailed description of the major 
routines of the Linking Loader, including flow 
charts. While implementing the system, the user 
has an opportunity to learn about the nature of 
linking loader design as well as simply acquiring 
a useful software tool.

TINY ASSEMBLER 6800, Version 3.1 is an en- 
hancement of Jack Emmerichs' successful Tiny 
Assembler. The original version (3.0) was de- 
scribed first in the April and May 1977 issues of 
BYTE magazine, and later in the PAPERBYTE™ 
book TINY ASSEMBLER 6800 Version 3.0. 
In September 1977, BYTE magazine published 
an article entitled, "Expanding The Tiny Assem- 
bler". This provided a detailed description of the 
enhancements incorporated into Version 3.1, 
such as the addition of a "begin" statement, a 
"virtual symbol table", and a larger subset of the 
Motorola 6800 assembly language. 
All the above articles, plus an updated version of 
the user's guide, the source, object and PAPER- 
BYTE™ bar code formats of both Version 3.0 
and 3.1 make this book the most complete docu- 
mentation possible for Jack Emmerichs' Tiny 
Assembler.

SUPERWCIMPCIS is an exciting computer game 
incorporating the original structure of the WGM- 
PCJS game along with added features to make it 
even more fascinating. The original game was 
described in the book What To Do After You Hit 
Return, published by the People's Computer 
Company. Programmed in both 6800 assembly 
language and BASIC, SCJPERWCJMPCIS is not 
only addictively fun, but also provides a splendid 
tutorial on setting up unusual data structures 
(the tunnel and cave system of SCIPERWCMPCS 
forms a dodecahedron). This is a PAPERBYTE™ 
book.

MONDEB: AN ADVANCED M6800 MONITOR- 
DEBCIGGER has all the general features of Mo- 
torola's MIKBCIG monitor as well as numerous 
other capabilities. Ease of use was a prime design 
consideration. The other goal was to achieve 
minimum memory requirements while retaining 
maximum versatility. The result is an extremely 
versatile program. The size of the entire MON- 
DEB is less than 3 K. 

Some of the command capabilities of MONDEB 
include displaying and setting the contents of 
registers, setting interrupts for debugging, testing 
a programmable memory range for bad mem- 
ory locations, changing the display and input 
base of numbers, displaying the contents of 
memory, searching for a specified string, copying 
a range of bytes from one location in memory to 
another, and defining the location to which con- 
trol will transfer upon receipt of an interrupt This 
is a PAPERBYTE™ book.

Antique 
Mechanical Computers 

Part 3: The Torres Chess Automaton 

Dr James M Williams 

58 Trumbull St 

New Haven CT 06510 

But now these men were 
suggesting that a machine 
could assist in or substi- 
tute for a human mental 
activity. 

19th Century Developments 

The automata of the 18th century were 
in fact sequence controllers possessing both 
digital and analog stored programs whose 
readouts were mechanisms that imitated 
human and animal actions (computers of a 
sort). During the next century they inspired 
a flood of automata, the best of which von 
Helmholtz described in his 1847 book, Uber 
die Erhaltung der Kraft, as being equal in 
achievement to the best in any other branch 
of science. Derek Price's book, Automata 
in History, includes material from von 
Helmholtz (see bibliographical notes). 

In the 19th century men were starting 
to contemplate how mechanisms might be 
able to improve the human state. Charles 
Babbage had this notion in mind when in 
December 1837, precisely 99 years after 
Vaucanson's marvelous demonstration (see 
July 1978 BYTE "Antique Mechanical 
Computers, Part 1 ") he wrote the first 
sentence of On the Mathematical Powers of 
the Calculating Engine: "The object of the 
present volume is to show the degree of 
assistance which mathematical science is 
capable of receiving from mechanism." An 
obscure accountant of Manchester, Percy 
Ludgate, working without knowledge of 
Babbage, expressed the same thought when 
he wrote in 1909 the first sentence of On a 
Proposed Analytical Engine: "I propose to 
give in this paper a short account of the 
result of about six years work, undertaken 
by me with the object of designing machin- 
ery capable of performing calculations, 
however intricate or laborious, without the 
immediate guidance of the human intellect." 

I think we may be too near to our machines 
to see the revolution residing in what these 
men said. Before Babbage and Ludgate, 
machines amplified or assisted or enabled 
the physical actions of humans. But now 

these men were suggesting that a machine 
could assist in or substitute for a mental 
activity of a human. Machines would enter 
into the realm of the human brain. It was 
a breathtaking idea, but not an easy one to 
put into effect. Babbage's two machines 
were never fairly begun, nor was Ludgate's. 
(In Babbage's case the reason was not that 
nineteenth century machine technology was 
unequal to the task, but rather because he 
kept changing his concepts and never pro- 
duced any completed working drawings as 
he continuously visualized bigger and bigger 
machines. For him, the end was never in 
sight, and he left off working at a point 
where the machine would have been the size 
of a basketball court and some yards high. 
His son completed the "Mill" (ALU) with 
its printhead long after Babbage's death, in 
1906. See Randell in the bibliographical 
notes for a photo of the Mill and a repro- 
duction of the printout of multiples from 
1 to 23 of 7r in 28 significant figures.) 

Torres and the Incredible Chess Playing 
Automaton 

Gifted chess players have been known to 
play several concurrent games, making 
moves without hesitation from board 1 to 
board n, then back to board 1. The best 
chess playing programs of today can't do 
that with any degree of success against most 
skilled players. But the remarkable fact is 
that in 1911 a machine was invented that 
automatically played a particular endgame 
of chess (King and Rook versus King) against 
a human opponent, and detected any false 
moves! 

Leonardo Torres was the inventor, and 
his machine was displayed in the Mechanical 
Laboratory at the Sorbonne early in 1914.

Photo 1 : Front (a) and back (b) views of the 1911 chess playing automaton invented by Leonardo Torres. The unit played a 
particular chess endgame (King and Rook versus King) only and could force a win. The chessboard is shown in the lower right 
of center in photo la. Horizontal and vertical arms moved the pieces (which were actually electrical jacks) from square to 
square, and the logic circuitry consisted of battery driven relays arranged in a logical tree structure (see figure 3). Photos cour- 
tesy of Scientific American (Supplement 80, Number 2079, November 1915). 

Torres was a true amateur 

who did his work because 

he loved it. 

machine. It seems to have been powered by 
the array of weights atop the console, but 
it used electricity (almost surely from a 
battery) in its logic system, which consisted 
of commutators and intricate switchgear. 
Indeed, most of the face of the console is 
covered with relays and switches with their 
linkages and wiring, but one can make out 
the vertical chessboard, sans chess pieces, in 
the lower right quadrant of the face. It is 
about 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) wide 
and has holes in the center of each of the 
64 squares that are really plug holes into 
which fitted the carved chess pieces (actually 
jacks on their lower ends used to make 
electrical contact). Sequential switches of 
two sorts are visible on the apron in the fore- 
ground, and the signalling lamps consist of 
a 3 lamp cluster in the middle with another 
single lamp on the right. 

The machine in operation must have been 
an amazing sight, for its visible action was 
automatic. The sliding arms (poorly shown 
in the photo; located both above and to the 
left of the board) would grasp the chosen 
White piece, unplug it, transfer it to a new 
computed location, and reinsert the piece 

into the board. Then it waited for Black's 
next move. This is a degree of automation 
I don't recall seeing since I last gazed at a 
Linotype, and in 1914 it must have been an 
awesome spectacle. To be sure, Black always 
was checkmated, even with the first move, 
since White (the machine) had too much 
strength. If Black made a false move, the 
machine would sense it and light a signal 
lamp, then wait until the piece was moved 
to a legitimate square. Three false moves in 
the course of a game would "jam" the 
machine, which would not continue play 
until a reset switch was closed and pieces 
were properly placed. Possibly the pieces 
could be placed anywhere on the chessboard 
upon initiating a game; accounts do not 
make this clear. At any rate, the algorithm 
is quite general and directs the White King a 
square at a time, and the White Rook a row 
or column at a time inexorably toward the 
Black King until he is hemmed in. 

In 1922 an improved version was dis- 
played. Photographs and a description may 
be found in Chapuis (see bibliographical 
notes). This more modern machine had a 
horizontal chessboard grooved to accom-

modate wires that sensed the location of a

when Black was checkmated. Figure 1 shows

and can be seen in the museum at the Poly- 
technic Institute in Madrid SPAIN. . . .CM/ 

Torres was one of those vital persons who 
ornaments the history of science: a person 
of intense curiosity and independent means 
who devotes time and energy to the explor- 
ation of arcane subjects many decades 
before the professionals find their way into 
the original excavations and mine the un- 
covered veins of ore left behind. He was a 
true amateur who did his work because he 
loved it; history is studded with these men: 
Schliemann, Humboldt, Lavoisier, Rumford, 
Kelvin, Babbage, Bohr, etc. 

Leonardo Torres was born in 1852 in 
Santander on the north coast of Spain, and 
was trained as a civil engineer. Unfortunately 
I could learn only very little about his life 
since the biography by his son is in French 
and is not available to me, but a few facts 
emerge: he was a patriot, and a capable 
politician as well, who arranged for the 
Spanish government to liberally subsidize 

his "large and well-equipped mechanical 
laboratory at Madrid." Perhaps this is 
related to the fact that in 1906 in Bilbao 
harbor he displayed before the King a small 
scale radio controlled boat which "could 
select between various rudder positions and 
speeds, and cause a flag to be run up and 
down a mast." A lifelong Francophile, 
during World War I he designed a plane 
called the Astra-Torres for the French Air 
Corps. He also pursued quite mundane 
things: designs for aerial cablecars, apparatus 
to test lubricating powers of oil, a "uni- 
versal pantograph" that automatically cor- 
rected any unwanted jiggles by a special 
linkage. 

One of his first interests was mechanical 
analog computing devices, perhaps before 
1900. He was familiar with Babbage's 
publications. In a paper dated 1920 he 
outlined an electromechanical calculating 
machine he exhibited in France. The machine 
consisted of a modified typewriter and 
several boxes of apparatus, connected only 
by a bundle of wires, all mounted on a 
table for display. (A picture of the machine 
is in Randell's book; see the bibliography.) 
The operator types in the numbers desired 
to be manipulated together with the sign of 
the operation to be performed, and after a 
few moments an = followed by the result 
is typed out. This is a 4 function machine 
that can deal with perhaps six or seven digits. 
This was in 1920, mind you! He revealed the

"Construction of mech- 
anisms which play the role 
of sense organs is not diffi- 
cult in theory." 

theoretical underpinning for his calculating 
apparatus in general terms in 1914, in the 
Essais sur I'automatique. (In 1914, auto- 
matique was a new word, translatable as 
automation or as automatics.) 

Torres' essay is so lucid and fresh that 
today, 64 years after publication, it still 
casts much illumination on the human and 
machine interface. After describing a first 
type of automaton, a machine designed to 
mimic the movements of a living creature, 
he describes a second type of automaton 
(Torres' own italics), ". . . those that imi- 
tate, not the simple gestures, but the 
thoughtful actions of a man, and which 
can sometimes replace him." He gives 
examples: "...the self-propelled torpedo, 
which knows how to maneuver in order 
to arrive at its target, the balance which 
weighs coins so as to choose the ones which 
are of legal weight." He speaks of the need 
for a ". . . special chapter of the theory of 
machines which would be called Auto- 
matics" and of the need to investigate 
"means for constructing automata endowed 
with a pattern of behavior of greater or 
lesser complexity." "These automata will 
have sense organs, ie: thermometers, mag- 
netic compass, manometers, etc" together 
with "limbs, ie: machines or mechanisms 
capable of executing the operations which 
they are instructed to do." And they will 
need power sources. "Moreover, it is essen- 
tial, being the chief objective of Automatics, 
that the automata be capable of discern- 
ment; that they can at each moment take 
account of the information they receive, 
or even information they have received 
beforehand , in controlling the required 
operation." "It is necessary that the automata 
imitate living beings in regulating their 
actions according to their inputs, and adapt 
their conduct to changing circumstances. " 

After noting that construction of mech- 
anisms which play the role of sense organs is 
not difficult in theory, and that new appa- 

ratus to achieve this measuring (sensing) 
function is invented every day (what cannot 
be measured today will be measured tomor- 
row or shortly), he adds that the same may 
be said of devices to effect the automaton's 
work. No one can point to a limit in the 
inventing of machines to perform functions. 
But, "It is not the same when one asks 
whether it is possible to construct an autom- 
aton which, in order to decide on its manner 
of working, ponders on the circumstances 
which surround it. The estimate is, I believe, 
that this may be done only in some very 
simple cases ... it is thought possible 
to automate the mechanical operations per- 
formed without thinking by a workman, but 
that those requiring the exercise of mental 
faculties will never be executed mechan- 
ically." "I shall try to show in this article, 
from a purely theoretical point of view, 
that it is always possible to build an autom- 
aton whose actions depend on a greater or 
lesser number of circumstances, according 
to rules which one can impose arbitrarily 
during its construction." In reference to 
this quote, Torres described a simple digital 
device, but with the novelty that it displays 
a worked out form of conditional branch- 
ing: ahead of its time, like so much of 
Torres' writings and work. 

In his writings, Torres selected his words 
so carefully that it is possible to argue his 
distinction between "to discern," a process 
of'input which he welcomes and illustrates 
as measurements; and "to ponder," a verb he 
seems to reserve for human thought, where 
more has to be taken into account than just 
the information of the moment or informa- 
tion previously received. And what is that 
"more"? I suggest that only people who 
know mechanics very well can appreciate 
fully the chasm between their creations and 
those of life (ie: between organic informa- 
tion and mechanical information). Randell 
observes, and I heartily agree, that "In all 
this work [Torres] was deliberately exploit-

'Dynabyte builds 
confidence into 
my computer." 

: i > . 

Piug-in-and-run performance takes the uncertainty out of 
owning a computer. That's the kind of computer products 
Dynabyte builds. 

Confidence in your computer is increased because you know 
that Dynabyte S-100 boards are factory assembled by trained 
technicians, burned in for 72 hours at elevated temperatures and 
continuously tested for three days. 

That was true of the industry's first assembled and tested 16k 
dynamic RAM from Dynabyte, and it continues with all the other 
products from Dynabyte. 

Once you plug Dynabyte boards in their careful design, 
factory prime components and quality construction keep them 
running. Dynabyte backs them with a one year warranty — the 
longest in the industry. 

Incompatability is coming to an end. Dynabyte's 16k and 32k 
static RAMs come with access times of either 250ns for Z-80A 
processors or 450ns for 8080 and 8085 chips. You can use the 

16k static RAMs with Alpha Micro or Cromemco bank switching 
memory expansion techniques. 

Computer users are so confident of Dynabyte's 16k dynamic 
RAM they have made it the most widely used S-100 dynamic 
memory in the world. 

If you intend to become a proficient data processor but 
instead are unhappily debugging your system, or want to avoid a 
lot of debugging, then Dynabyte will be a great choice. 

As you spend less time monkeying with hardware and more 
time computing, you'll become more confident of your abilities 
and proud of your accomplishments. Isn't that what owning a 
computer is all about? 

Tell your computer retailer with confidence that you want

ing the new facilities that electromechanical 
techniques offered and challenging accepted 
ideas as to the limitations of machines." 
But he not only exploited, he revelled; he 
did more than challenge: he expressed his 
disbelief and undertook to amaze his 
skeptics. 

Torres worked on what he enjoyed, and 
a spirit of breathless, childlike fun is visible 
in all his activities. Imagine in 1906 a radio 
controlled boat that coasts up to a dock 
where stands the King of Spain, cuts its 
engine, heels sharply to starboard, and runs 
the royal flag smartly up and down the 
mast! The King salutes, the crowd cheers 
/ Viva la Espaha! What ecstasy it must have 
been for Torres. This is something beyond a 
demonstration of Hertzian waves as applied 
to potential weapons of war. It is something 
human: a radio controlled triumph. But such 
moments do not recur frequently. Torres 
the inventor-scientist is almost surely speak- 
ing in this quotation from the Scientific 
American article (see bibliography) about 
his 1911 chessplayer: "There is no claim 
that it will think or accomplish things where 
thought is necessary, but its inventor claims 
that the limits within which thought is 
really necessary need to be better defined, 
and that the automaton can do many things 
that are popularly classed with thought." 
You can hear the muted sadness, the resigna- 
tion mingled with pride. Well, it still can 
play a flawless endgame of chess. If only it 
could be made to live. The next one I make 
will, at least, talk. 

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES 

The information in these articles has been 
synthesized from various sources I have 
encountered in reading about the history 
of computers, several histories of which 
make mention of Vaucanson in the sen- 
tence that directly precedes the one 
about Babbage. I found no literature 
explaining Vaucanson's creations until I 
came across: 

Chapuis, Alfred E, and Droz, Edmond, Auto- 
mata: Historical and Technological Study, 
Editions du Griffon, Neuchatel SWITZER- 
LAND, 1958. 

Here an astonishing and catholic variety 
of automated devices are described and 
illustrated, most of them trivial, such as 
pictures with clockwork-driven, moving 
figures. It is maddening that Chapuis' 
Automata treats the great mechanical 
computers of the past with little care. 
Chapuis and Droz were in a unique posi- 
tion because they read French, the 
language of most of the original docu-

merits. They had pursued the field of 
automata so long (Chapuis & Edouard 
Gelis published Le Monde des Automates 
in 1928, as well as making a film about 
automata in 1945) that their fame on the 
continent would have enabled them to 
study the machines minutely. They 
meticulously reconstructed the dates of 
inception, untangled the inventors of 
automata, and deduced the fate of the 
machines. Their myriad illustrations are 
unsurpassable. 

2. You can read a translation of Vaucanson's 
own description of his automata in: 

Ord-Home, Arthur W J G, Clockwork Music, 
Crown Publishers, New York, 1973. 

which is currently in print. This book 
mentions and illustrates the Eureka 
poetry composing machine, a violin 
playing device, and quotes a newspaper 
account of one or two astonishing autom- 
atons (unless they are fabricated) such as 
a life-size mannequin that plays violin 
sonatas under keyboard control. There is 
little else of interest regarding stored pro- 
grams. Lots of fun, though.

great many mechanisms and machines 
from the historical viewpoint, but 
describes them hardly at all is: 

Price, Derek J deSolla, Automata in History: 
Origins of Mechanism and the Mechanistic 
Philosophy, Technology and Culture, volume 5, 
number 1, 1964. 

which is worthwhile for the long per- 
spective it offers on mechanics, and for 
the sense of continuity it conveys regard- 
ing human endeavor. You begin to learn 
that the world has always been filled with 
restless, thoughtful, imaginative and inven- 
tive people. 

4. It is fun to read a splendidly researched 
volume like: 

Carroll, Charles Michael, The Great Chess 
Automaton, Dover Publications, New York, 
1965. 

which is still in print and describes a 
nearly century long hoax (for which 
Vaucanson had unwittingly cleared the 
path), as well as Maelzel's actual mechan- 
ical achievements that blossomed into an 
industry by 1900. 

5. For me the doyen of computer historians 
is: 

Randell, Brian, The Origins of Digital Com- 
puters: Selected Papers, Springer Verlag, 
Heidelberg, New York, 1973. 

where the developments that preceded 
and led up to the digital computer are 
spelled out event by event. As if Randell's 
crystalline commentary were not enough, 
he includes original papers (some in lucid 
translation) by Babbage, an incredibly 
clever man, and just about everybody 
who did anything useful in the develop- 
ment of computers, such as Aiken, Hop- 
per (the only woman in the book), 
Eckert, Von Neumann, Goldstine, and 
Mauchly. They are included here, along 
with Leonardo Torres. Many machines 
are also included, such as the Zuse relay 
computer of wartime Germany, the Bell 
Labs relay computer, Altanasoff's Iowa 
State computer with its novel capacitor 
storage system, and of course, EN I AC 
and EDSAC, those feeble giants.

Let Your Fingers Do the Talking 

Scanner Applications 

Qispcis's 
Circuit Qellap 

Steve Ciarcia 
POB 582 
Glastonbury CT 06033 

/ would like to thank 
Dr Russell Relss for con- 
tributing ideas which have 
led to this and other 
articles. . . .SC 

In "Let Your Fingers Do the Talking — 
Add a Noncontact Touch Scanner to Your 
Video Display" (August 1978 BYTE, page 
156), I detailed the hardware design of a 
noncontact touch scanner which sits over a 
conventional video screen. This system, 
though lower in resolution, allows a fingertip 
to simulate the function of a light pen and 
with proper programming can become as 
important a peripheral as the common 
ASCII keyboard. 

Quick Hardware Review 

The scanner consists of 32 pairs of in- 
frared light emitting diode transmitters 
and photo transistor receivers arranged 
around the perimeter of a picture frame. 
There are 16 pairs on the X axis and 16 pairs 
on the Y axis. The hardware logic sequen- 
tially activates the 32 pairs, first in the X 
direction (horizontal) then in the Y direc- 

Photo I : The basic information returned from the touch panel is a coordinate 
pair for one of 256 possible finger sized locations on the video display 's face. 
Here, using the program in listing 3, the displayed coordinates 10 and 9 
correspond to the point just touched on the screen. 

tion (vertical). If a physical obstruction is 
placed in the plane of the scan, one X and 
one Y beam are interrupted. The corres- 
ponding X and Y beam addresses are stored 
when this happens. Since there are 16 pairs 
per axis, each coordinate can be represented 
by a 4 bit code and both the X and Y 
addresses can be packed into one data byte. 

The end result of the hardware logic is a 
very simple scanner to computer interface. 
The scanner output is one 8 bit byte con- 
taining the 4 bit X and 4 bit Y addresses. 
The only other signals are a little something 
often referred to as hand shaking. A data 
ready line is set to a high level output when 
the scanner has sensed an obstruction. 

This data ready signal can be tied to a 
parallel input port and scanned as I have 
done, used as a control line on a peripheral 
interface circuit, or used directly to generate 
a processor interrupt. If the touch panel is to 
be exercised in BASIC, the first method will 
prove to be easiest. The latter method, nor- 
mally used with a machine language program 
rather than BASIC, will be the most efficient 
from a memory utilization standpoint. 

I continue to use BASIC wherever the 
interface data processing speed allows it. In 
this way I can write illustrative program ex- 
amples which are not tied to a particular 
processor. Of course, the speed advantages 
of machine language may be useful if your 
programs using the touch panel have a lot to 
do; so feel free to strike out on your own 
using these BASIC programs as a model. 

Whatever the software method utilized to 
recognize the data ready bit, the program 
action must be the same. After the data 
ready bit goes high, the data byte is stored 
and the data ready is reset by momentarily 
pulsing the ready reset line low. In BASIC, 
the easiest way to do this is to tie the ready 
reset line to one bit on a parallel output port 
(it need only be a strobe rather than a 
latched output) and then sequentially 
execute two OUT instructions. The 10 ms 
pulsewidth I get on my machine is the result 
of the time it takes for BASIC to respond. 
The program examples presented in the 
listings use the following port allocations (in 
decimal):

Using the touch panel in any BASIC pro- 
gram, whether it be game or instructional, 
will necessitate having a subroutine to read 
and reset the scanner placed somewhere 
within the BASIC program. The total soft- 
ware necessary to exercise the touch panel 
is shown in listing 1. 

If a GOSUB 100 command is encount- 
ered, BASIC vectors to this subroutine and 
begins execution. This subroutine will not 
return until someone touches the screen. 
Variable D1 would contain the X coordinate 
and D2 would contain the Y value. Each call 
to this subroutine results in returning to 
the main program with the X, Y address of 
a single touched point. To obtain ten touch 
inputs would require calling this routine ten 
times. 

The simplest program utilizing the scan- 
ner would be one which sensitizes the entire 
screen to act as one giant push button. Such 
a program is similar to a press any key op- 
tion on a keyboard. 

The program in listing 2 prints "MY 
SCREEN ITCHES!! PLEASE SCRATCH 
IT!" on the video screen, waits for some- 
one to touch any place on the screen and 
then responds with the message in line 30. 
Notice that we did not use the coordinate 
information from the scanner because we 
only needed to take advantage of the fact 
that the subroutine returns only if data is 
ready. 

Test the Coordinate System 

If one builds the touch panel, the first 
program written should be one that illus- 
trates the coordinate system dynamically, 
such as the program in listing 3. (All 
BASIC programs in this article are written 
in Micro Com 8 K Zapple BASIC.) 

After printing an opening comment on 
the video screen, the program calls the 
scanner subroutine as before. This time 
when it returns, it prints out the X and Y 
coordinate which was touched as shown in 
photo 1 . The rest of the program is a repeat 
of this basic cycle with one exception. The 
values of D1 and D2 are both compared to 
15 after each scan. Should you point at 
coordinate position (15,15) the program 
ends. 

Converting Position to Function 

So far we have displayed only the raw 
output of the scanner and have not used it 
in its true application. Telling you that you 
are pointing to location (4,2) illustrates that 
the touch panel functions, but does no use-

Heathkit H8 Owners: 

SERIOUS? 

Powerful Capaoilities 

The only full size dual diskette 
system configured especially for the 
Heathkit H8 Computer is now avail- 
able for immediate connection. The 
INFO 2000 Disk System is the best 
performer for any microcomputer: 
it's incredibly fast, it uses full 8" 
diskettes, and it gives you immediate 
Z80 capability. The recording format 
is standard IBM 3740. So you're as- 
sured maximum storage capacity, sup- 
erior error protection, and full inter- 
changeability with other CP/M* based 
systems. 

Simple Connection 

The Disk Adapter Board supplied 
with the INFO 2000 Disk System con- 
tains its own Z80 microprocessor. Just 
swap this board with the 8080 that 
came with your H8 and you'll have in- 
stantly upgraded to a Z80 microcom- 
puter. The Z80 instruction set includes 
158 — more than twice as many as the 

3080. Z80 instructions feature power- 
ful block transfer, block search, block 
I/O instructions, relative addressing, 
bit manipulation, index registers and 
greatly enhanced interrupt processing. 
All you need to do is plug in the adap- 
ter board, cables and AC power, and 
you're ready to run. 

Hassle-Free Operation 

Designed just for the H8, the 
INFO 2000 Z80/Disk Adapter Board 
includes an EPROM containing 
PAM-Z. This is a Z80-oriented panel 
monitor which permits the H8 front 
panel to operate in both hexadecimal 
and octal modes. A CP/M disk operat- 
ing system is included which enables 
you to use Disk BASIC, FORTRAN, 
COBOL, PASCAL and hundreds of 
applications programs. Plus, you can 
still utilize all Benton Harbor software. 
The flick of a switch gives you either 
software mode . . . instantly! You 
should have a minimum of 16K RAM, 
and to take full advantage of all the 
software you can implement, 32K is 
recommended. You'll also need the 
standard Heath serial board and a 
terminal for a full system. 

upgrade your H8 
to a Z80 with the 

DISK SYSTEM 

We're Serious 

The H8 is a good beginning. But 
why stop there. Go for the best. With 
this combination of low cost computer 
and a powerful disk system, you can 
now perform a tremendous range of 
tasks. Use your H8 as a sophisticated 
business system and a powerful design 
and development tool. 

If you're serious. 

Delivered assembled and factory- 
tested, the complete disk system in- 
cludes dual diskette drives, Z80/Disk 
Adapter Board, power supply, cabinet, 
cables, and CP/M disk operating sys- 
tem. Full price $2950. Available for

of an ordinary 4 function calculator. The imagination of the user, to use a 
well-worn cliche, is the only limitation upon trying experiments with special 
purpose keyboards and interactive sequences on the screen. Use of the video 
display behind the touch panel area makes easily altered software the deter- 
mining factor — rather than physical tools in the workshop.

ful work. If instead some letter or word 
were at (4,2) and the program used this 
higher function output rather than just the 
numerical coordinate, we'd have something. 

Fortunately it isn't all that difficult. By 
dividing the scanner system into fields and 
having each field represent a function, wc 
can do useful work. A 2 level program must 
be written. First, it should have the capa- 
bility of formatting the screen so that the 
printing is beneath the proper touch coor- 
dinate. Then, after returning from the scan- 
ner subroutine, it must translate this posi- 
tion value into the function designated by 
the printing on the screen. 

A simple program which divides the 
screen into four fields or sectors and per- 
forms a function dependent on which sector 
is touched is shown in listing 4. Figure 1 
describes the mathematical relationship 
between the coordinate system and the 
BASIC program of listing 4. 

After printing the opening lines on the 
screen the program calls for the data from 
the scanner. The X coordinate (D1) is first 
tested to sec if it is greater than 7. If it is, 
then either sector 3 or 4 must have been 
chosen. If D1 is less than 7 then it must be 
sector 1 or 2. After choosing whether it is 
the right or left half of the screen the test 
is repeated with the Y coordinate. In theory, 
this binary search method would require no 
more than eight such tests if all 256 points 
were designated as separate fields.

concept is used in the calculator of photo 2. 
While never meant to replace the hand held 
calculator it uses a routine similar to the 
previous example to determine the action 
of each of the 16 possible entries. The 
picture is included to present the reader with 
one of the many possible applications of 
the scanner. The program, however, is quite 
long and difficult to explain in an intro- 
ductory article such as this. 

Simulated Keyboard 

One use of the touch panel would be the 
simulation of direct keyboard entry. Ob- 
viously this technique is valuable only where 
limited data entry is required. Large menu 
selection programs with numerous choices 
displayed may not always have the parti- 
cular item of interest. By having one of 
the available selections be a keyboard 
display and entry routine such as photo 3 
and listing 5, the miscellaneous entry could 
be accommodated. The program of listing 5 
displays a keyboard on the video screen and 
allows one to type by pointing to the in- 
dividual characters. The example does not 
include punctuation and a carriage return, 
but they could be easily accommodated. 

One final note. Using the touch panel 
need not eliminate the standard ASCII key- 
board as an input device. By using the 
BASIC INPUT command, keyboard entry 
is still available to the user as is the scanner 
through a callable subroutine. A program 
could be written where some entries come 
from the touch panel and others from the 
keyboard. A more versatile program would 
allow input from either device at any time. 

Listing 6 is a simple program which 
demonstrates how BASIC can scan two in- 
put devices simultaneously and provide 
appropriate response. 

I hope that this touch panel design will 
spark the creative interests of other com- 
puter enthusiasts. In a field where tech- 
nology advances by leaps and bounds and 
product obsolescence can be described in 
months, innovative ideas are necessary to 
extend the concept of creative home com- 
puting. By adding advanced peripherals and 
high level languages, system obsolescence is 
delayed considerably. 

Next month: build a 5 W dual voltage DC 
to DC converter for your interfaces."

EXCITING 

That's the word that sums up the dynamic small computer show in New 
York that was established last year at the Coliseum. The lecture areas were 
filled by interested people, the exhibits were great, the attendance was the 
highest of any small computer show in the country. 

The big point is that everyone who came went away happy. Accountants, 
hobbyists, lawyers, doctors, brokers, retailers, business people, program- 
mers, research scientists and just plain homeowners. 

The second big point is that we're doing it again. This time, bigger and 
better. Top seminars, top exhibits.

S2L An Altair (S-100) 

to LS1-11 Bus Adaptor 

For many months, those of us who ad- 
mire the architecture of the PDP-11 com- 
puters have been looking for a way to adapt 
the wealth of Altair (S-100) bus products 
to this processor. The introduction of the 
Heath H11 (LSI-11 based) processor has 
further emphasized the need to solve the 
problems which have thus far made the 
LSI-11 incompatible with the Altair (S- 
100) bus peripherals. This article describes 
the problems which exist, and one solution 
which I see for them. It has been written 
in advance of actually implementing the 
solution, but it should prove valuable to 
all those experimenters who wish to take up 
the challenge of an LSI-11 to Altair bus 
adapter. 

For years, the only problem with the 
LSI-11 as a personal computer has been 
price. The processor board (KD11-F) it- 
self is a rather good deal at a discount level 
of 20 to 30 percent, but the accessories 
are somewhat expensive compared with 

typical personal computing products as 
seen in table 1 . 

Most of the extra expense of the LSI-11 
systems can be attributed to three factors: 

1. The DEC prices are generally higher. 
The memory prices demonstrate this. 

2. The use of highly regulated power 
supplies with the DEC products re- 
sults in a more costly power supply. 
In addition, few experimenters are 
likely to homebrew such a power 
supply due to its complexity and its 
being the single element which could 
cause major destruction should it 
fail. 

3. The LSI-11 has no front panel 
switches, and instead requires the 
user to examine and modify the state 
of the machine via a serial console 
device. While most industrial cus- 
tomers of DEC are able to afford the 
high cost of a serial terminal, many

hobbyists have discovered that 
memory mapped video is both cheaper 
and faster than a serial device. Be- 
cause of this, DEC's decision to use 
the serial interface in this fashion 
forces a user to either support two 
terminals (one serial and one memory 
mapped) or make do with the serial 
device. It is unfortunate that a serial 
device, at any reasonable data rate, 
is simply unacceptable for some of 
the applications which an experiment- 
er might wish to pursue, one example 
of which is state of the art word 
processing applications. 

The three conflicting forces of the high 
prices of the LS 1-1 1 systems, the desire 
for that processor's architecture, and the 
problems with the serial terminal require- 
ment have kept me from going ahead with 
an LSI-11 system for well over a year. I 
have finally started on a project of my own 
which is to adapt an LSI-11 to Altair (S-1 00) 
bus peripherals and memory. 

My idea was that, since the widest variety 
of reasonably priced peripherals are available 
on the Altair (S-1 00) bus, I should build an 
Altair (S-1 00) to LSI-11 bus adaptor (S2L). 
In order to start the design of an Altair 
bus adaptor, a number of decisions had to 
be made. Initially, I decided that splitting 
the 16 bit LSI-11 bus (also known as the 
"Q" bus) into two 8 bit Altair (S-1 00) 
buses, one for the even bytes and one for 
the odd bytes, would create too much 
havoc. Certainly one could purchase pairs 
of memory boards and allocate them in the 
memory address space appropriately, but 
when dealing with devices such as memory 
mapped video displays, adjacent bytes on 
the screen would be every other byte in the 
address space of the LSI-11. Additionally, 
two of every card would be needed in most 
cases, and adjacent memory mapped IO 
ports (the only type being considered in 
the case of the PDP-11 architecture) would 
be on alternate cards. For this reason, I 
felt that only one Altair (S-1 00) bus should 
be connected to the bus adaptor. This 
implied that multiple byte reads and writes 
would have to be performed by the bus 
adaptor and some sort of state machine 
would have to be built to do this. 

The project was made more difficult 
by the fact that the LSI-11 allows both 16 
bit word width reads and writes, as well as 
single byte writes. (Single byte reads are 
not required, since the processor can ignore 
whatever data it wishes.). Additionally, a 
read modify write cycle is provided, and that 
had to be supported by the bus adaptor.

Figure I: Block diagram 
of the S2L interface which 
a/lows Altair (S-100) bus 
peripherals and memory 
to be used with the 
LSI-ii "Q" bus. Details 
of memory control, in- 
terrupt control and DMA 
control logic blocks are 
found in figures 7, 8 and 
9 respectively. 

Finally, both direct memory access and 
vectored interrupts had to be supported if 
there was to be any hope of running LSI-1 1 
software on the beast which would result. 
It should be noted that just because a 
memory address responds from the Altair 
(S-100) bus, that doesn't mean that it 
couldn't be built to look to the LSI-1 1 as 
if it were a "normal" LSI-1 1 device inter- 
face. I wouldn't be giving up the facility to 
use standard PDP-11 software by building 
this bus adaptor, but merely making it a bit 
more difficult. 

I should note here that what follows 
is an untested design based on the refer- 
ences given at the end of the article and 
some conversations with friends who have 
Altair (S-100) systems. A variety of Al- 
tair (S-100) schematics from Processor 
Technology, IMSAI, Technical Design Labs 
and Cromemco, to name a few, were 
scanned to try to insure some approxima- 
tion of compatibility, but the design is 
neither built nor tested. I welcome any 

comments from readers who are interested 
in this project. 

The block diagram of the S2L bus inter- 
face box is shown in figure 1. It consists of 
three main sections devoted to memory 
signals, direct memory access signals and 
interrupt signals. The schematics for the 
control logic blocks may be found in figures 
7 thru 9, but for the time being, I will 
discuss their function rather than their de- 
tailed implementation in order to simplify 
the discussion. 

Let us first consider a memory read 
operation as diagrammed in figure 2. Note 
that all times in the timing diagrams are 
sequenced correctly, but, many times 
they are not to scale. Also, note that the 
clock (<£>2) may be shown as being synch- 
ronous with some signals, but this is not 
necessarily so since the LSI-1 1 bus is an 
asynchronous bus. The LSI-1 1 indicates 
the start of a bus cycle by asserting the 
BSYNC L signal. ("Asserted" means going 
into a logical 1 state, not becoming +4.5 V;

You Own 
the Solution, 
We Offer You 
the Problem! 

If you own a micro- 
computer, you may face a 
fairly common dilemma: 
scarcity of applications. 
After the initial hardware 
thrill has worn off, what are 
you going to do with all that 
computing power? 

Every two months, 
Strategy & Tactics Magazine 
publishes something to do 
with that power. It's called a 
conflict simulation — a 
game-like re-creation of a 
real-world military battle or 
campaign. In such a conflict 
simulation, all the relation- 
ships of the various military 
units, the terrain, and the 
objectives are quantified 
and classified in a very 
orderly and rigidly specified 
manner. The unique data 
handling/problem solving 
opportunities are fascinating 
and plentiful — indeed, they 
are the chief attractions for 
most serious players. 

Many of the sub- 
routines in conflict simula- 
tions are naturals for 
computerization. For exam- 
ple, combat is usually

resolved by recourse to a 
probability table using dice; 
movement is regulated by 
digitally valued hexagonal 
cells; and most events are 
ordered by a program-like 
"sequence of play." In fact, 
the games in Strategy & 
Tactics are virtually paper 
programs needing only your 
ingenuity and enthusiasm to 
interface with the micro- 
computer environment. 

Every issue of 
Strategy* Tactics comes 
with a complete conflict 

simulation game plus a 
feature length, data-rich 
article on the same subject. 
In addition, there are other 
articles on historical and 
contemporary military af- 
fairs along with information 
about the latest simulation 
game designs offered by

Figure 3: Timing diagram of an LSI-11 memory write (16 bit word) cycle as 
It is interpreted by the S2L interface and passed on to the A/tair (S-100) bus. 

I am using the trailing "L" to denote nega- 
tive logic, so in this case assertion means 
going to 0.4 V.) The negative logic used 
by all LSI-11 bus signals is due to the bus 
being implemented with open collector 
logic, rather than the three state logic which 
is common in most hobby computers. The 
rising edge of BSYNC should be used to 
latch the data and address bus lines (BDALO 
L to BDAL15 L), since at this time they 
contain the address for the bus cycle. When 
BDIN L is asserted, the first of the two 
Altair (S-100) bus cycles occurs. This cycle 
occurs during the first complete cycle of 
the S2L clock that occurs after BDIN L 
is asserted. The first byte read is the most 
significant byte of the word (ie: the byte 
with the odd address), and the LSCMP 
signal is asserted during this time in order 
to provide the correct address on the Altair 
(S-100) bus. I am assuming that since only 
16 bit word reads may be made, all addresses 
on the bus during read cycles will be even 
addresses. 

The falling edge of the S2L clock (<J> 2 ) 
latches the most significant byte of data 
enabled by the low state of the MSBCLK 
signal ( ® in figure 2). Then the second 
read cycle is initiated, this time for the least 
significant byte (even address). When the 
cycle completes, the least significant byte 
is latched with the next S2L clock enabled 
by a low state on the LSBCLK signal ((§) 
in figure 2). After this, LDEN is asserted 
to drive the latched data onto the LSI-11 's 
"Q" bus, and BRPLY L is sent back to the 
LSI-11 to tell it that the data on the bus is 
valid. The termination of the BDIN signal 
indicates to the S2L that the data has been 
accepted by the LSI-11, and the S2L then 
terminates BRPLY L. 

For this interface to work with a reason- 
able variety of Altair (S-100) bus memory 
boards, phase 2 clock, RDY1, RDY2 and 
WAIT signals are provided. Any S2L clock 
pulse may be inhibited by one or both of 
the RDY lines until a slow peripheral has 
data ready, or has accepted data, in a 
manner similar to that of the 8080 and 
6502 processors. 

The write cycle, diagrammed in figure 
3, is almost identical to the read cycle. The 
differentiation between read and write is 
made by the LSI-1 1 by asserting the BDOUT 
L signal rather than BDIN L. During a write, 
rather than having to provide two clocks to 
latch the bytes read, the S2L must provide

Osborne Et Associates announces two new books. 

AN INTRODUCTION TO MICROCOMPUTERS: 
VOLUME 2 - SOME REAL MICROPROCESSORS 
VOLUME 3 - SOME REAL SUPPORT DEVICES 

There are hundreds of microprocessors on the 
market today, but there's nothing like Volume 2 and 
3. These books provide the only detailed descrip- 
tions of real products from an independent source. 

NEW MICROPROCESSORS 

Volume 2 describes individual microprocessors, and 
support devices commonly used only with the 
parent microprocessor. The new edition represents 
a massive expansion of our previous Volume 2; 
among other new material it includes the first 
detailed description of the Intel 8086 16-bit 
microprocessor. 

NEW SUPPORT DEVICES 

Volume 3 describes support devices that can be 
used with any microprocessor. The majority of this 
book is new material; in particular it has one of the 
most comprehensive discussions of memory 
devices ever printed. 

NEW UPDATES 

Because of the tremendous amount of material 
that Volumes 2 and 3 must cover, these books have 
been written to be updated on a regular bimonthly 
schedule. Six update sections for each of the two 
volumes may be purchased on a yearly subscrip- 
tion basis. Each update will describe new products, 
or products not covered in the original volumes; 
updates also provide additional information for 
products already included, and errata pages for 
previous text. 

NEW FORMAT 

For your convenience, Volumes 2 and 3 are printed 
in loose leaf form and may be purchased with or 
without a binder. 

The 1978 edition of Volume 2 and the new Volume 3 
of AN INTRODUCTION TO MICROCOMPUTERS will 
be available at the end of September. To order

DIRECT MEMORY ACCESS ACTIVITY- 

Figure 5. Timing diagram for the initiation of DMA activity on the Altair 
(S-100) bus between memory segments on that bus and peripherals on that 
bus. (DMA from an Altair (S-100) bus peripheral to peripherals or memory 
on the LS/-J1 "Q " bus is not supported in this design.) 

a byte selection signal (DOUTSEL) to a 
multiplexer which will determine which 
half of the word will be written at any time. 
The timing is as in the figure. As in the case 
of the read, I assume that only word width 
writes will occur with a word (even) address. 

In order to perform a single byte write 
cycle, the S2L performs a normal write 
cycle, except that it skips the first of the 
two Altair (S-100) bus writes. Since it is 
the write to the address with the inverted 
lowest bit which is skipped, the correct 
byte is written in half of the time, and the 
cycle terminates normally. The diagram for 
this is shown in figure 4. 

The LSI-11 bus supplies signals with 
which the memory and device interfaces 
reply to the LSI-11 when 10 transactions 
take place (BRPLY L). The S2L adaptor 
will respond with a BRPLY L signal whether 
the address requested is implemented or 
not. This will cause problems with some 
LSI-11 software and firmware, especially 
the firmware ODT LOAD command which 
sizes memory automatically by sensing when 
memory addresses fail to set a BRPLY L 
response. Also, the system of reply signals 
has another advantage which will be lost 
when using the S2L adaptor: when attempt- 
ing to write to ROMs on the LSI-11 system, 
no BRPLY L is generated and a bus time- 
out error occurs, which is a good error 
detection system. The S2L will effectively 
eliminate this facility. 

The procedure for dealing with direct 
memory access (DMA) is much easier on 
the Altair (S-100) bus than on the LSI-11 
bus, and the S2L interface enables the 
Altair (S-100) devices to take advantage 
of the simpler protocol. Looking at figure 5, 
the device starts the DMA cycle by asserting 
the HALT L signal to request use of the bus. 
The assertion of BDMR L by the S2L 
requests the use of the bus by a peripheral 
of the LSI-11. The simultaneous assertion 
of BDMGI L and the termination of BSYNC 
L and BRPLY L indicates that the DMA 
privilege has been granted by the LSI-11. 
The S2L then responds by terminating 
the BDMR signal, and by asserting both 
the BSACK L signal to tell the LSI-11 that 
the bus is in use, and the HLDA L signal to 
tell the Altair bus peripheral that it may now 
use the bus. Note that if more than one 
peripheral wishes to perform direct memory

access, neither will be able to determine 
easily which device is being selected. When- 
ever the Altair (S-100) bus peripheral is 
finished with the bus, it terminates the 
HALT L signal, causing the S2L to terminate 
the BSACK L signal, releasing the bus for 
the LSI-11 to use. 

Note that this interface will not allow 
Altair (S-100) bus devices to perform DMA 
to any memory which is on the LSI-11 side 
of the S2L; I felt that the simplicity of the 
interface as shown, combined with the 

complexity of the extended function inter- 
face, was justification for leaving things 
as shown. In any event, one justification 
for the development of this adaptor was that 
Altair bus memory was cheaper than DEC 
memory, so one can expect most of the 
system memory to be Altair (S-100) bus 
memory. 

One other point to make is that the 
LSI-11 on board memory is dynamic and 
requires refreshing, which the LSI-1 1 does 
by microcoded routines. This microcoded 
refresh creates bursts of bus activity every 2 
ms, lasting about 130 jus. These bus acti- 
vations can cause problems in a real time 
environment, and can cause data overruns 
in DMA devices if these devices do not 
allow enough internal buffering to last the 
130 /is. Although nonburst-mode refresh 
is possible, the prices which DEC asks for 
the module are pretty high for the facility. 
For this reason, use of Altair (S-100) bus 
static memory and disabling of the KDH-F's 
dynamic memory and refresh microcode 
might be useful to some people. 

The eight vectored interrupt lines on the 
Altair (S-100) bus lend themselves directly 
to interfacing with DEC's vectored interrupt 
scheme. Looking at figure 6, the timing for 
the S2L's interrupt sequence is given. When- 
ever one of the vectored interrupt inputs 
from the Altair (S-100) bus (VIO thru VI7) 
is asserted, BIRQ L is sent back to the 
LSI-11 to request interrupt service. The

BASIC BASIC by James S Coan 

LI If you're not already familiar with BASIC, James Coan's Basic 
BASIC is one of the best ways to learn about this popular computer 
language. BASIC (which stands for Beginner's Ail-Purpose Symbolic 
Instruction Code) is easy to learn and easy to apply to many pro- 
blems. Basic BASIC gives you step-by-step instructions for using a 
terminal, writing programs, using loops and lists, solving mathe- 
matical problems, undertanding matrices and more. The book 
contains a wealth of illustrations and example programs, and is 
suitable for beginners on many different levels. It makes a fine 
reference for the experienced programmer, too. $8.95. 

ADVANCED BASIC by James S Coan 

I I Advanced BASIC is the companion volume to James Coan's 

Basic BASIC. In this book you'll learn about some of the more 
advanced techniques for programming in BASIC, including string 
manipulation, the use of files, plotting on a terminal, simulation 
and games, advanced mathematical applications and more. Many 
useful algorithms are covered, including some clever sorting tech- 
niques designed to reduce program execution time. As with Basic 
BASIC, there are many illustrative example programs included. 
BASIC doesn't have to be basic with Advanced BASIC! $7.95.

LSI-11 will respond by asserting BIAKI L 
and BDIN L, the former to request that an 
interrupt vector be placed on the bus, and 
the latter to indicate that data is coming 
in on the bus. The S2L responds to this by 
placing the vector on the bus, and by assert- 
ing BRPLY L, to inform the LSI-1 1 that the 
bus value is now valid data. The termination 
of BDIN L and BIAKI by the LSI-1 1 results 
in the S2L's termination of BRPLY L and 
the release of the bus for other uses. At 
this point, an interrupt should occur. Each 
of the eight interrupt lines is prioritized 
and will cause an LSI-11 interrupt when 
asserted. The LSI-1 1 vector address for each 
Altair (S-100) bus vectored interrupt line 
will be the value programmed in the read 
only memory. 

I am not going to go through the sche- 
matics in figures 7 thru 9 in detail, since 
their function is fairly well-defined by the 
timing diagrams and the above discussions. 
However, a few notes are in order. The use 
of the 7495 is a bit subtle since the load, 
which occurs via CLK2 whenever a BDIN or 

BDOUT signal is asserted, changes the mode 
of the shift register from LOAD to SHIFT. 
This allows the first write to be skipped 
conditionally upon the state of the BWTBT 
L signal at the start of the write cycle, and 
allows the shifting to stop when the one bits 
coming in from the serial input reach the 
third flip flop. The latches used for most 
significant byte and least significant byte 
storage are 8551s since they have three 
state buffers, which allow their output to 
be placed on the LSI-1 1 bus conditionally."

TM 

The Electric Pencil II is a Character Oriented 
Word Processing System. This means that text is 
entered as a string of continuous characters and 
is manipulated as such. This allows the user 
enormou= freedom and ease in the movement and 
handling of text. Since line endings are never 
delineated, any number of characters, words, 
lines or paragraphs may be inserted or deleted 
anywhere in the text. The entirety of the text 
shifts and opens up or closes as needed in full 
view of the user. The typing of carriage returns 
as well as word hyphenation is not required 
since lines of text are formatted automatically. 

• 1978 Michael Shrayer 

As text is typed in and the end of a screen 
line is reached, a partially completed word is 
shifted to the beginning of the following line. 
Whenever text is inserted or deleted, existing 
text is pushed down or pulled up in a wrap 
around fashion. Everything appears on the video 
display screen as it occurs which eliminates any 
guesswork. Text may be reviewed at will by 
variable speed scrolling both in the forward and 
reverse directions. By using the search or the 
search and replace function, any string of 
characters may be located and/or replaced with 
any other string of characters as desired. 

When text is printed, The Electric Pencil II automatically inserts carriage returns where they 
are needed. Numerous combinations of line length, page length, line spacing and page spacing allow 
for any form to be handled. Character spacing, BOLD FACE, multicolumn as well as bidirectional 
printing are included in the Diablo versions. Right justification gives right-hand margins that are 
even. Pages may be numbered as well as titled. This entire page (excepting the large titles and 
logo) was printed by the Diablo version of The Electric Pencil II in one pass.

About the Author 

Joel Boney is currently 
employed by Motorola in 
its Integrated Circuits Divi- 
sion plant In Austin TX. 
He is responsible for the

tem and architectural de-

chips. He is currently 
Involved in the MC6809 
and MC6805 projects. 

Your system is completed. You bought a 
kit with lots of memory and spent many 
hours assembling it. The manufacturer's 
manuals are dog eared. You've read various 
works on computer programming which 
inspired you to write integer multiply and 
divide routines and create your own mathe- 
matical statement processor. The routines 
are thoroughly debugged and now you are 
ready to enter your first mathematical state- 
ment: 5 •*• 2 =. The computer promptly 
responds with '2'. Well, that's not really 
wrong in integer arithmetic where remainders 
are often dropped, but most of us learned in 
the third grade that 5-^2 really equals 2.5. 
How do you get your computer to answer 
2.5 instead of 2? Read on. The answer lies 
in floating point or real representation and 
manipulation of numbers. 

Floating Point 

A floating point number is a number that 
can be representated by an integer portion 
and a fractional portion. The number 2.5 is 
a floating point or real number; so arc 3.3, 
0.9 and 2.0. All can be represented by an 
integer part and a fractional part. The num- 
bers: 1, 8 and 1 7 are not real since they have 
no fractional portion. Numbers in scientific 
notation such as 2.37 X 10° are real. 

Before jumping head first into how to 
represent floating point numbers in the com- 
puter, an understanding of how floating point 
numbers are representated in base ten is 
instructive. For example, in the number 
125.76, the digit positions correspond to:

Figure I : Format for the arrangement of data in the computer's memory for 
the binary floating point representation described here. The high order bit 
of byte 2 will usually be 7 ' because of normalization. The only time that this 
will not happen is when the number being represented is zero. 

1 X 10 2 = 100.00 
2X 10 1 = 20.00 
5X10° = 5.00 
7X10^ 1 = 0.70 
6X10- 2 = 0.06 

The decimal point merely tells where the 
boundary exists between the positive powers 
of ten and the negative powers of ten. Num- 
bers to the left of the decimal point are 
positive powers of ten and those to the right 
are negative powers of ten. In binary (base 2) 
numbers the same rule applies. The base 10 
equivalent of the binary number 101.11 is: 

I X 2 2 =1X4 
0X2 
1 X 1 
1 X .5 
1 X .25

I X 2 

-1 

I X 2" 2 

4.00 
0.00 
1.00 
0.50 
0.25 

5.75 

The '.', which is now called a binary 
point, denotes the division between positive 
and negative powers of two. This concept 
can be expanded to any base, but here we 
will only consider base 10 and base 2. In 
general the '.' might be called the "base 
point." 

Quite often it is more convenient to 
represent real decimal numbers in scientific 
notation. This allows both very small and 
very large numbers to be written with the 
fewest number of digits (eg: 3.75 X 10 — ' , 
rather than 0.000000000375). Numbers in 
scientific notation are represented by three 
parts: integer portion, fractional portion and 
exponent. In order to conserve memory 
within the computer and to make calcula- 
tions have fewer steps, it is more convenient 
to represent all real numbers with only a 
fraction and an exponent. This is accom- 
plished by moving all digits to the right of 
the base point while adjusting the exponent 
appropriately. Thus all numbers are of the 
form: .FFF X I0 EE in base 10 (where 
"FFF" are the fractional digits and "EE" 
is an expression for the power of ten ex- 
ponent). This change of form does not in 
any way alter the value of the number or 
change the accuracy of the subsequent 
calculations. For example: 3.75 X 10^

becomes 0.375 X 10^ thus eliminating 
the integer portion of the number. 

If the fractional portion of a number 
has a fixed number of digits as is the case 
within a computer, then the greatest ac- 
curacy is achieved if the digit following 
the base point is nonzero. Using a 5 digit 
fraction, the number 0.37868 X 1CP is more 
accurate than 0.03787 X 10 6 . We now have 
formulated two rules that will make calcula- 
tions easier and maintain maximum accuracy: 

• Floating point numbers will consist 
of only a fraction and an exponent. 

• Floating point numbers will be adjusted 
so that no zeros immediately follow 
the base point. 

The only exception to these rules is the 
number zero which is allowed to violate 
rule two. Manipulating numbers so that 
they conform with the above rules is called 
normalization. 

All of the above examples were in base 
ten, but as might be expected the concepts 
are just as valid in base two except the 
exponent is now a power of two instead 
of ten. Therefore, numbers are of the form: 
.FFF X 2" (where FFF and EE are now 
hexadecimal representations of binary num- 
bers). At this point we must decide upon 
a specific format to use within the computer 
that will give sufficient accuracy without 
wasting memory. A fraction containing 
24 bits gives an accuracy of 1/2^4 or about 
seven decimal places. A two's complement 
exponent of base 2 containing seven bits 
gives an exponent range of approximately 
±10* . This format has sufficient magni- 
tude range for many applications and can 
represent numbers over 38 decimal orders 
of magnitude. 

There are several common formats for 
floating point numbers. In some, the expo- 
nent is a power of 16 and a fraction is 
considered normalized if any of the four 
most significant bits are set. Exponents 
are often represented in "excess" form 

Listing 1: Algorithm for inputting real numbers. This algorithm will result 
in a floating point number in the four byte form described in this article.

instead of two's complement form. In this 
form some appropriate number is added to 
all exponents so they are all positive. The 
specific format I chose consists of four 8 
bit bytes for each number and is shown in 
figure 1. The high order bit (bit 7 typically) 
of byte one is the algebraic sign of the 
number (1 = — ). The low order seven bits 
of the first byte (bit 6 to bit 0) are the 
signed two's complement value of the 
exponent. Bytes two, three and four contain 
the normalized unsigned fraction with the 
understood binary point preceding byte two. 
Note that bit seven of byte two is 1 for all 
normalized numbers except zero because of 
normalizing rule two. 

Some sample numbers and their decimal 
equivalents are given in table 1 . 

Ins and Outs 

Now that we've defined a format for real 
numbers, how can we put it to use? Several 
subroutines will be required. We need to be 
able to read real numbers from a terminal 

September 1978 © BYTE Publications Inc 115 

and convert them to our defined format and 
vice versa. Also, we need to outline how we 
can operate on real numbers once they are 
converted. First, the ins and outs. 

The conversion to and from the terminal 

Table 2: Decimal fraction to binary equivalent conversions. The table covers 
only the first seven digits since the accuracy of the routines we are consider- 
ing is only seven places. This conversion assumes that the exponent is set to 
zero.

is the most difficult part of handling floating 
point numbers. An attempt is made here to 
outline a procedure that is well adapted to 
microprocessors. Several other algorithms 
are outlined in The Art of Computer Pro- 
gramming, volume 2 by Donald Knuth (see 
references following this article) including 
information on converting to and from 
scientific notation. 

Suppose the input string 1 3.05 is typed at 
a terminal. Since the computer will see the 
characters as they are typed left to right, the 
program in listing 1 can easily convert any 
number preceding the decimal point into a 
binary integer. In this example the 13 
becomes 00001101, assuming an 8 bit 
integer. Once the decimal point is read the 
fraction can be calculated if a table of 
unnormalized fractions corresponding to the 
binary equivalent of 10 — n is stored in 
memory. Since there is no need for n to be 
larger than the accuracy of the final format, 
table 2 was calculated with n equal to seven. 
Table 2 was calculated using a BASIC pro- 
gram to determine which bits in the fraction 
should be set. Note that the fractions in this 
table are 32 bits wide instead of the 24 bits 
required in the final answer. This is done to 
insure the accuracy of the conversion. Using 
this table and starting with a zero exponent 
byte and zero in a 4 byte fractional portion 
in the answer, when the first number fol- 
lowing the decimal point is typed on the 
terminal it is multiplied by the table value of 
the fraction for 0.1 and added to the frac- 
tion of the answer. Subsequent inputs are 
multiplied by 0.01, 0.001, etc, and added to 
the answer until the bottom of the table is 
reached after seven inputs or the input 
string is exhausted. Since the input numbers 
are thru 9, it is easier and takes less time in 
a microprocessor to do the multiplication 
by successive additions. For the example 
input, 13.15, the fraction is calculated by 
example 1. Including the integer portion 
and the exponent the input becomes the 
representation in example 2. Normalizing 
this by shifting the integer and fraction four 
bits to the right and adding 4 to the expo- 
nent it becomes example 3. 

Now the integer portion and the low 
order byte of the fraction can be deleted 
after incrementing the next to low order 
byte if bit seven of the low order byte was 
set (rounding up). See example 4 for the 
final value in the correct 4 byte format. Had 
the input number been -13.05 instead of 
+13.05, the only difference in the number 
generated would be bit seven of the expo- 
nent (fraction sign bit) would be set. Note 
that if the input had been something like 
0.005 the normalizing process described 
above would require left shifts of the frac-

tion while decrementing thus creating a 
negative exponent. 

Outputting real numbers is slightly more 
difficult. The fraction and exponent part 
must be dealt with simultaneously since 
conversion of the exponent from base 2 to 
10 will affect the fraction. Due to this com- 
plexity, it is preferable to output real num- 
bers in scientific notation. The output form 
that is used is 1305 E + 2 instead of 
0.1305 X 10 +2 . 

To accomplish the conversion we will 
need a rather large (4 by 128 byte) table to 
convert 2 e (where e is the exponent of the 
real number to be output) to F X 1 Ex P 
(where F is an unnormalized fraction in our 
3 byte notation and Exp is the power of 10 
of the number we wish to print. A portion 
of the middle of the table is given in table 3. 
The base 2 exponent e is not a member of 
the table, but is used as the index into the 
table to retrieve values of Exp and F. Using e 
we access the table and multiply the fraction 
F times the fraction of the number we wish 
to output using a multiply fraction sub- 
routine described later. The resultant frac- 
tion of this multiplication will be the frac- 
tion that must be converted and printed 
followed by the letter E and the decimal 
value of Exp, including its sign, from the 
table to obtain the desired scientific 
notation. 

Printing of the fraction uses the same 
table as used for converting to real format. 
In the first iteration the binary fraction for 
0.1 is subtracted from the fraction until the 
fraction goes negative. For each subtraction 
except the last a counter is incremented and 
becomes the number to print. After the 
number is printed, the fractional value of 
0.1 is added back into the fraction. This 
whole process is effectively a binary divide 
by 0.1. After 0.1 is added back, the pro- 
cedure is repeated for 0.01, 0.001, etc, until 
all seven output digits are printed. This 
process is summarized in listing 2. 

It should be noted that the above algo- 
rithms pose particular problems on various 
implementations and the programmer should 
be cautious of such things as overflow and 
carry flags as well as round off errors while 
doing the multiprecision operations. 

The Arithmetic 

Now we have a format for floating point 
or real numbers and we know how to input 
and output them. All that remains is the 
internal manipulation subroutines. All these 
subroutines require two normalized real 
arguments, which in the following text and 
listings will be referred to as argument 1 
(ARG1) and argument 2 (ARG2). They all 

Listing 2: Algorithm for outputting real numbers. This algorithm uses table 2 
to convert the fraction. The output algorithm shifts the fraction and integer 
part left until the exponent equals zero or bit 7 of the integer word is set 
to I. If bit 7 of the integer word is set, any further shifts will destroy the 
number. 

Type entry = record of 
Exp: 8 bit binary 
F: 24 bit fraction 
Var conv- table: array [—64. .63] of entry 

table: array [1..7] of 24 bit fraction 
(* e is the base 2 exponent of the number to be output*) 
Begin 

Fraction: = conv-tablefe ] .F * fraction of number to be output 
If Fraction sign = 1 then print '— '; endif 
Print decimal point 
N: = 1 

Do while N <8 
CTR: =-1 

Do while fraction is positive 
Fraction: = fraction-table(N) 
CTR: = CTR+ 1 
Enddo 

Fraction: = fraction + table (N) 
Convert CTR to ASCII and print it 
Enddo 
Print 'E' 

If conv-table[e] .Exp is negative then print '— '; Endif 
Convert conv-table[eJ .Exp to decimal ASCII and print it 
End 

create a normalized real answer (ANS). We 
will use the predefined format except that 
during the internal manipulation some extra 
bits are occasionally needed at the right of 
the fraction to retain accuracy. Only a 
couple of bits are necessary, but since most 
microprocessors have 8 bit words, it is easier 
to add a whole byte to each fraction thus 
creating a 4 byte fraction instead of the 
prescribed three bytes. This fraction will be 
rounded to a 3 byte fraction in the defined 
format before returning to the caller of the 
manipulation subroutines. 

Addition is defined as ARG1 + ARG2 = 
ANS. Once again the base 10 analogy will be 
useful in understanding how to implement 
an algorithm. If we desire the sum of the 
two normalized real numbers 0.375 X 10-> 
and 0.22 X 10 4 , we must first make the 
exponents equal before we can add the 
fractions. Once the exponents are equal, the 
fractions can be added and the answer given 
the common exponent. Thus, the example 
becomes: 

0.375 X 10 5 
+ 0.022 X 10 5 

0.397 X 10 5 

To make the exponents equal in this 
example, the number with the smaller expo- 
nent was shifted right n decimal digits and 
its exponent incremented by n. It is desir- 
able to adjust the smaller number since 
shifting the larger number would require 
left shifts that might result in numbers 
being shifted into the integer portion which 

September 1978 © BYTE Publications Inc 117 

would violate the defined format. Any 
shifting, however, can create accuracy 
problems in a fixed digit (or bit) computer, 
since if the magnitude of two numbers 
differs by a large amount, their sum will be 
equal to the larger number. For example, if 
we had a calculator with six digits for a 
fraction and we added 0.300 X 10 8 and 
0.20 X 100, the answer would be 0.300000 
X 108 since shifting 0.20 seven digits to the 
right would cause it to become zero. 

Listing 3: Algorithm for real addition and subtraction. Before additions or 
subtractions can take place the numbers must be manipulated so that their 
exponents are equal. 

Begin 

Do while exponent ARG1 i= exponent ARG2 
If exponent ARG1 > exponent ARG2 then 
Shift fraction ARG2 right one bit 
Increment exponent ARG2 
Else 

Shift fraction ARG 1 right one bit 
Increment exponent ARG1 
Endif 
Enddo 

If fraction ARG1 is negative then 2's complement fraction ARGI;Endif 
If fraction ARG2 is negative then 2's complement fraction ARG2;Endif 
If operation is addition then 

Fraction ANS: = fraction ARG1 + fraction ARG2 
Else 

Fraction ANS: = fraction ARG1 - fraction ARG2 
Endif 

Exponent ANS: = exponent ARG1 or ARG2 
Normalize ANS 
Roundup ANS 
End 

Listing 4: Real multiplication algorithm. When multiplying real numbers it 
is not necessary to worry about the exponents being equal. Multiplication 
can take place under any conditions. 

Begin 

Fraction ANS: = fraction ARG1 * fraction ARG2 

Exponent ANS: = exponent ARG1 + exponent ARG2 

Set overflow flag if exponent overflowed or underflowed 

Normalize ANS 

Roundup ANS 
End 

Listing 5: The real division routine must check to see if the dividing number 
is zero. If it is, the overflow flag is set and the routine is ended. The frac- 
tional part of the number to be divided should always be smaller than the 
dividing number. This is assured by shifting the number to be divided one 
place left and incrementing the exponent. 

Begin 

If fraction ARG2 = then 

Set overflow flag 
Else 

Shift fraction ARG1 one bit right 

Increment exponent ARG1 

Fraction ANS: = fraction ARGl/fraction ARG2 

Exponent ANS: = exponent ARG1 - exponent ARG2 

Set overflow if exponent overflowed or underflowed 

Normalize ANS 

Roundup ANS 
Endif 
End 

Binary real addition is identical to the 
above decimal example except the shifts are 
by n binary bits and the exponent is a power 
of 2. The algorithm in listing 3 first checks 
to see if the exponents are equal. If not 
equal, the fraction of the smaller argument is 
shifted one place right and its exponent 
incremented. This continues until the 
exponents are equal. Since our format stores 
the fractions as absolute unsigned values, all 
the fractional portions of negative fractions 
must be two's complemented before addi- 
tion can proceed. Once the negation of any 
negative fractions is completed, the fractions 
can be added by a multiprecision addition. 
The fractional portion of the answer is then 
composed of the sum of the adjusted frac- 
tions and the exponent becomes the com- 
mon exponent. This answer may need to be 
normalized. In fact, all the manipulation 
subroutines will require a check for normali- 
zation before exit, and therefore a subrou- 
tine to normalize arguments is desirable. 

Subtraction is defined as ARG1 — ARG2 
= ANS. The subtraction routine is identical 
to the addition routine except a multiple 
precision subtract is substituted for the 
addition. In most implementations the 
addition and subtraction routines are the 
same routine with a flag to indicate whether 
a subtraction or addition of the fraction 
should occur. 

Multiplication of real numbers is easier 
than addition since the fractions can be 
multiplied regardless of the exponents. 
The multiplication algorithm in listing 4 
is defined as: ARG1 * ARG2 = ANS. The 
multiplication of the fractions involves a 
32 bit by 32 bit multiplication, but only the 
most significant 32 bits of the result are 
necessary which reduces the complexity of 
the multiplication somewhat. 

For details on writing a multiplication 
subroutine check the references, or better 
yet check the user group library for your 
microprocessor to see if one already exists. 
The biggest problem with real multiplication 
is that overflow or underflow of the expo- 
nent can occur during the addition of the 
exponents. Therefore, the subroutine must 
take precautions to check for overflow or 
underflow and flag the result as erroneous 
if either occurred. The answer obtained by 
the above algorithm may need to be normal- 
ized before returning it to the caller. 

Division is similar to multiplication and 
is defined as ARG1/ARG2 = ANS. Since 
most division algorithms will not terminate 
if ARG2 is equal to zero, the division 
algorithm in listing 5 first checks the frac- 
tion of ARG2 to see if it is zero. If it is 
zero, the algorithm should return with an

overflow indication. Also, many division 
algorithms require that the fraction of 
ARG1 be smaller than the fraction for 
ARG2. The division routine could check to 
see if this condition exists, or better yet, 
since we know both numbers are normalized 
(ie: the most significant bit is set) and since 
we have added an extra byte for accuracy, 
we can always shift ARG1 one bit to the 
right and insure that it is less than ARG2. 
Of course, we must add one to ARGVs 
exponent to compensate for the right 
shift. Now we can proceed with a normal 
32 by 32 bit divide of the fractions. Once 
the fractional portion of the answer is 
complete, the exponent of the answer is 
equal to the exponent of ARG1 minus the 
exponent of ARG2. Again precautions must 
be taken to insure (or at least flag) that no 
underflow or overflow of exponents has 
occurred. The answer may need to be 
normalized. 

Conclusion 

This article has attempted to give an 
overview of what is necessary to create a 
package of floating point subroutines that 
can be used for many applications. Floating 
point manipulation is not trivial and some 
microprocessors will be better adapted to 
the task than others. Instructions that can 
handle multiple precision arguments such 
as "add with carry," "subtract with carry" 
in conjunction with shifts and rotates on 
memory make the implementation simpler. 
Be cautioned that the procedures outlined 
are general and any particular microprocessor 
will require special procedures to adjust for 
processor peculiarities. In any case, it seems 
the majority of the code is dedicated to 
shifting fractions right or left to insure 
accuracy or in checking for various error 
conditions. 

On the positive side, a good debugged 
binary floating point package takes less 
memory and runs faster than the decimal 
floating point implemented in many BASIC 
packages. The add, subtract, multiply and 
divide routines lay the framework for the 
programmer to create more exotic subrou- 
tines such as sine, cosine, etc. Best of all, 
when we ask our computer to divide 5 by 2, 
it responds with 2.5."

in a complete family of models. And, like our MacroFloppy™ family of disk 
drives, MetaFloppy is designed for the S-100/8080/Z-80 bus. 

For maximum capacity, choose our new MetaFloppy:1054 system. Which 
actually provides you with more than a million bytes of reliable on-line stor- 
age. For less money than you'd believe possible. 

The MetaFloppy:1054 comes complete with four drives in dual config- 
uration. A controller. Power supply. Chassis. Enclosure. All cabling. A new BASIC 
software package. And a DOS with assembler and editor. There's even a built- 
in Autoload ROM to eliminate tiresome button pushing. 

If that's more storage than you need right now, try our 
MetaFloppy:1053, with 630,000 bytes on-line. Or our Meta- 
Floppy:1043, with 315,000 bytes on-line. Either way, you can 
expand to over a million bytes on-line in easy stages, when you 
need to. Or want to. 

In other words, if your application keeps growing, we've got 
you covered. With MetaFloppy 

The system that goes beyond the floppy.

Bit Pad is the low-cost digitizer for small computer systems. 
Better than a joystick or keyboard for entering graphic in- 
formation, it converts any point on a page, any distance into its 
digital equivalents. It's also a menu for data entry. You assign a 
value or an instruction to any location on the pad. At the touch 
of a stylus, it's entered into your system. 

Who can use it? Anyone from the educator and the engineer 
to the hobbyist and the computer games enthusiast. The data 
structure is byte oriented for easy compatibility with small 
computers, so you can add a power supply, stand alone dis- 
play, cross-hair cursor and many other options. 

Bit Pad by Summagraphics. The leading manufacturer of 
data tablet digitizers. Bit Pad. The only words you need to say 
when considering digitizers. 

$1,000 creativity prize. Just write an article on an original Bit 
Pad application and submit it to any national small-computer 
periodical. If the editors publish it — and the decision is solely 
theirs — Summagraphics will pay you $1,000.

Plugging 

the KIM-2 Gap 

One of my uses of the KIM-1 computer 
is to create programs that will execute on a 
smaller dedicated 4 K byte 6500 processor 
such as the 6505. However, the user manual 
for the KIM-2 4 K byte memory expansion 
says the following: 

Note. . .It is not possible to put your 
expansion memory in the memory 
block 0400-1400 hex already decoded 
on KIM-1. 

I want to use the addresses hexadecimal 
0000 to 0FFF to hold all the programs and 
simulated 10 routines that will eventually 
go in the 6505, then use addresses hexa- 
decimal 1000 to 13FF for the programs 
that test the 6505 programs. Readers with 
the same problem may care to use my 
solution which I have been using successfully 
for some months. 

Use address switch setting 0001 for an 
address range of hexadecimal 1000 to 1FFF. 
Then modify the connections for address 
lines AB10, AB11 and AB12 as in figure 1. 
This modification will map the KIM-1 
address range of 0400 to 13FF into a KIM-2 
address range of 1 000 to 1 FFF." 

Figure 7 : Modification to allow the address of the KIM-1 from hexadecimal 
0400 to 13FF to be mapped into a KIM-2 address range of 1000 to 1FFF.

Globs and Newsletters 

DIRECTORY 

The following is the second BYTE Clubs and Newsletters Directory (the 
first was published in January 1977 BYTE). The directory was compiled 
from information supplied by the various clubs listed. A form was sent to 
all clubs and newsletters listed in the first directory requesting up-to-date 
information. If the form was not returned, we deleted the club from the 
second directory. In addition, the listing was correlated with back issues of 
the magazine and materials on file in the BYTE offices. If information is 
missing in one or more categories, it means the data was not provided. We 
will be keeping the file available and updating it for the next directory; so, if 
there are errors or if you have a new club which has just been formed, send 
the information to: Laura Hanson, Clubs and Newsletters Editor, BYTE

BASIC is BASIC is . . . 

And BASIC does what it should. But if you're ready to step up 
from Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic /nstruction Code, look 
at OPUS, the high-level 8080/Z80 language from A.S.I. ...roots 
in BASIC, but designed for business applications. OPUS gives 
you the capabilities you need, like extended precision, string 
handling, and easy formatting. OPUS/TWO takes up where 
OPUS/ONE leaves off, allowing subroutines, overlays, and 
extended disc file management. 

But we didn't stop there. OPUS programs and data are 
directly upward-compatible, all the way up through TEMPOS, 
A.S.I.'s multi-user, multi-tasking operating system. 

Ask your dealer, or contact A.S.I. We'd like to tell you more.

stop reading uboufcomputers and yet your hands on one ! With 
ELF II and our new Short Course by Tom Pittman, you can 
master computers in no time at all! ELF II demonstrates all 91 
commands an RCA 1802 can execute and the Short Course 
quickly leaches you how to use each ot'the lK02's capabilities. 

ELF IPs video output lets you display an alphanumeric 
readout or graphics on any TV screen or video monitor plus 
enjoy the latest video games, including an exciting new 
target/missile gun game that was specifically developed for 
ELF U. 

But that's not all. Once you've mastered computer funda- 
mentals, ELF M can give you POWER with add-ons that are 
among the most advanced found anywhere. No wonder IEEE 
chapters plus hundreds of universities and major corporations 
have chosen the ELF 11 to introduce their students and per- 
sonnel to microprocessor computing! 

Learn The Skill That May Soon Be Far 
More Important Than Your College Degree! 

The ability to use a computer may soon be more important to 
your earning power than a college degree. Without a knowl- 
edge of computers, you are always at the mercy of others when 
it comes to solving highly complex business, engineering, in- 
dustrial and scientific problems. People who understand com- 
puters can command MONEY and to get in on the action, you 
must learn computers. Otherwise you'll be left behind. 

ELF II Is The F-A-S-T Way To Learn 
Computer Fundamentals! 

Regardless of how minimal your computer background is now, 
you can learn to program a computer in almost no time at all. 
That's because Netronics has developed a special Short 
Course on Microprocessor And Computer Programming in 
non-technical language that leads you through every one of the 
RCA COSMAC 1802's capabilities so you'll understand 
everything ELF II can do . . and how to get ELI 7 II to do it! 

All 91 commands that an 1802 can execute are explained to 
you, step-by-step. The text, written for Netronics by Tom 
Pittman. is a tremendous advance over every other program- 
ming hook in print. 

Keyed specifically to the ELF II, it's loaded with "hands 
on" illustrations. When you're finished, ELF II and the 1802 
will no longer hold any mysteries to you. 

In fact, not only will you be able to use a personal computer 
creatively, you'll also be able to read magazines such as 
BYTE. .. INTERFACE AGE ... POPULAR ELEC- 
TRONICS and PERSONAL COMPUTING and under- 
stand the articles. 

If you work with large computers, ELF 11 and our short 
Course will help you to understand what makes them tick.

as FORTRAN and BASIC must be translated into machine 
language before a computer can understand them. With ELF 
II you build a solid foundation in computers so you'll really 
know what you're doing, no matter how complicated things 
get. 

Video output also makes ELF 11 unique among computers 
selling for such a low price. Attached to your TV set. ELF II 
becomes a fabulous home entertainment center. It's capable of 
providing endless hours of fun for both adults and children of 
all ages! ELF II can create graphics, alphanumeric displays 
and fantastic video games. 

No additional hardware is required to connect ELF II to 
yourTV's video input. If you prefer to connect ELF II to your 
antenna terminals instead, simply use a low cost RF modulator 
(to order one, see coupon below). 

ELF II's 5-card expansion bus (connectors not included) 
allows you to expand ELF II as your needs for power grows. If 
you're an engineer or hobbiest. you can also use ELF II as a 
counter, alarm, lock, thermostat, timer or telephone dialer, or 
for countless other applications. 

ELF II Explodes Into A Giant! 

Thanks to ongoing work by RCA and Netronics, ELF II 
add-ons are among the most advanced anywhere. Plug in the 
GIANT BOARD 1 -* and you can record and play back programs, 
edit and debug programs, communicate with remote devices 
and make things happen in the outside world. Add Kluge Board 
to get ELF II to solve special problems such as operating a 
more complex alarm system or controlling a printing press. 
Add 4k RAM board and you can write longer programs, store 
more information and solve more sophisticated problems. 

Expanded, ELF II is perfect for engineering, business, 
industrial, scientific and personal finance applications. No 
other small computer anywhere near ELF II's low price is 
backed by such an extensive research and development pro- 
gram. 

The ELF-BUG'-* Monitor is an extremely recent break- 
through that lets you debug programs with lightening speed 
because the key to debugging is to know what's inside the 
registers of the microprocessor and, instead of single stepping 
through your program, the ELF-BUG'-* Monitor, utilizing 
break points, lets you display the entire contents of the regis- 
ters on your TV screen at any point in your program. You find 
out immediately what's going on and can make any necessary 
changes. Programming is further simplified by displaying 24 
bytes of RAM with full address, blinking cursor and auto 
scrolling. A must for serious programmers! 

Netronics will soon be introducing the ELF II Color 
Graphics & Music System — more breakthroughs that ELF II 
owners will be the first to enjoy! 

Now BASIC Makes Programming ELF II Even Easier! 

Like all computers, ELF II understands only "machine 
language" — the language computers use to talk to each other. 
But, to make life easier for you, we've developed an ELF II 
Tiny BASIC. It talks to ELF II in machine language for you so 
that you can program ELF II with simple words that can be 
typed out on a keyboard such as PRINT, RUN and LOAD. 

"Ask Now What Your Computer Can Do . . . 
But What Can It Do For YOU!"

there is to know about ELF II or any

Don't be trapped into buying a dinosaur simply because you 
can afford it and it's big. ELF II is more useful and more fun 
than "big name" computers that cost a lot more money. 

With ELF II, you learn to write and run your own programs. 
You're never reduced to being a mere keypunch operator, 
working blindly with someone else's predeveloped software. 

No matter what your specialty is, owning a computer which 
you really know how to use is sure to make you a leader. ELF 
1 1 is the fastest way there is to get into computers. Order from

Introducing G/2 Standard 
Basic for the SWTPC com- 
puter series. It'll load faster 
and do more than you ever 
thought possible. 

Developed by Micro- 
soft™ the industry leader 
in microprocessor languages, 
and proved for more than 3 
years in MITS applications, 
G/2 Standard Basic is now 
available for the first time 
for use with Southwest Tech- 
nical Products Corporation's 
6800 hardware. 

Four to eight times faster 
than the basic you're now 
using, this interpreter offers 
string arrays, extensive string 
functions, Peek, Poke, Wait 
and Continue, direct execu- 
tion of statements in the 
calculator mode, 10 nested 
machine language sub- 
routines, multidimensional 
arrays and much more. And 
it uses only 7K of memory. 

Available now on cassette 
tape with full documentation

TURN YOUR COMPUTER 
INTO A TEACHING MACHINE 

The staff at Program Design did not learn 
about educational technology from a book — 
we wrote the book! We have been innovators in 
such teaching materials as programmed instruc- 
tion and multimedia presentations. We also belong 
to that minority in education who actually test ma- 
terials to see that people can learn from them. 

Now Program Design brings this experience to the personal 
computer field. PDI is developing a line of educational and 
game programs for the whole family — from preschool child to 
adults. 

Program Design educational software uses the computer's full teaching 
potential in exciting and effective ways. Programs are simple to use and 
memory efficient, and most important . . . they teach!

People hove used our originol model CB-0 Controller 
Doord for controlling audio systems, model railroads, time 
lapse photography, and dozens of other applications re- 
quiring intelligent, computer-controlled switching. 

Our improved model CD-1 has oil the features of its 
predecessor^ 8 relays that respond to an 8 bit word for 
control purposes, 8 opto-isolators that accept input dato 
for handshaking or further control purposes, full S-1 00 buss 
compatibility, address selection switch, quality com- 
ponents and board, and so on. 

Cut . . . the limited use (and expensive!) flat cable con- 
nector has been replaced with new connectors,- these 
allow you to use pairs of wires of mixed gauges and 
lengths as needed. Also, a self-test feature is built on the 
board itself, and a new output design allows replacement 
of the relays with opto-isolators. 

The best part is that you don't pay a penny more for 
these new features. In fact, compared to the CB-0 price, 
you pay 2,900 pennies less. 

Available at computer stores nation-wide, or by direct 
mail (mail orders shipped postpaid in USA, Californians 
and sales tax).

LSI-11 TIME 

It's TIME you brought your LSI- 11 up to DATE. TIME and 
DATE, two important parameters in the computer world, are 
available to your LSI-11 on one DUAL SIZE BOARD. When 
requested, the TCU-50D will present you with the date (month 
and day), time (hour and minutes), and seconds. Turn your 
computer off and forget about the time — your battery sup- 
ported TCU-50D won't, not for 3 months anyway. The correct 
date and time will be there when you power up. 

The TCU-50D is shipped preset to your local time, but can be set 
to any time you want by a simple software routine. 

AT $295 
YOU CANT AFFORD TO IGNORE TIME 

Time is only one way we can help you upgrade your LSI-11 or 
PDP-11 system. We'd also like to tell you about the others. So 
contact Digital Pathways if you're into -ll's. We are too.

At first it might seem odd to review the 
8080 Programmer's Pocket Guide and the 
8080 Hex Code Card at the same time, but 
they both serve as quick references for 8080 
assembler programming and hand assembly 
of the resulting programs. Either one alone is 
a great improvement over thumbing through 
the appendices of larger books; ideally you 
should have both. 

The 8080 Programmer's Pocket Guide is a 
small booklet (4.5 by 3.5 inches, 11.5 by 9 
cm) intended as a quick reference to the 
8080 instruction set. It has three sections. 
The first is a discussion of each instruction 
in the set describing what it does, what flags

it affects, and the octal and hexadecimal 
values for it. The second part is a discussion 
of a program for loading Intel hexadecimal 
format paper tapes. The third section is a 
summary of the instruction set ordered by 
function. This gives the instruction, its octal 
and hexadecimal values, the number of cycle 
states, and the page on which the instruction 
is discussed. 

I find this booklet very useful. There is, 
however, one minor blemish that may con- 
fuse some users. Parts of the booklet are 
adapted from Scelbi's 8080 Software 
Gourmet Guide and Cookbook. This cook- 
book, like previous Scelbi publications, uses 
a set of mnemonics which were based on 
those for the 8008. Scelbi has since changed 
over to the standard Intel 8080 mnemonics, 
and they use the standard ones throughout 
the pocket guide. However, some of the 
discussions taken from the previous book 
still use the old mnemonics (eg: LBA rather 
than MOV B, A). Also, the text occasionally 

refers to appendices from the cookbook. But 
these are minor problems; the booklet is 
well worth having. 

Tychon's 8080 Hex Code Card (15 by 8 
cm) is a slide rule type summary of the 8080 
instruction set. Also available is a card for 
those who prefer octal. The front of the card 
gives all the instructions and their hexa- 
decimal values, and tells how each instruc- 
tion affects the flags. The back of the card 
gives an ASCII chart, a hexadecimal to 
binary conversion chart, a chart of the 
register pairs, and one of the flag byte. The 
card itself is made of fairly heavyweight 
cardboard. If Tychon ever puts a plastic card 
out I'll be among the first to buy it, since 
the present card is used so much that I may 
wear it out. If you ever hand assemble pro- 
grams for the 8080, I highly recommend this 
card.

Making an H9 
Understand 
Lower Case 

George J Frye 

Frye Electronics Inc 

POB 23391 

9826 SW Tigard St 

Tigard OR 97223 

We have been using the Heathkit LSI-11 
computer as supplied with their model H9 
CRT terminal and recently ran into an inter- 
esting problem. Source programs that in- 
cluded lower case alphabetical ASCII char- 
acters would not read out on the terminal 
in an intelligible way; the 64 character 
generator just went bananas and inter- 
preted these lower case characters as slashes, 
percent signs, etc. 

I have also noted that some other devices, 
such as the Practical Automation DMTP-6- 
uP Printer, also use 64 character sets, and 
may be faced with the same problem. 

The Heath terminal is easily modified so 
that both upper and lower case alphabetical 
characters read out as upper case. (Some 
form of this modification may also work 
with the above printer.) 

Heath feeds the character generator chip, 
IC205, with a 6 bit signal latched through 
from the ASCII bus. The most significant 
data line is latched onto the character 
generator board but not run to IC205. A bit 
of study will show that changing the drive 
to the most significant bit of IC205 from 
ASCII bus line 6 to an inverted ASCII bus 
line 7 will cause the character generator 
to recognize lower case and upper case 
alpha characters as upper case (Tektronix 
uses this trick in their display terminals). 

The modification is easily done by 
cutting the run from pin 1 5 of IC203 (bit 6) 
to pin 1 of IC206, soldering in a wire from 
pin 10 of IC203 (bit 7) to pin 11 of IC219, 
and soldering in another wire from pin 10 
of IC219 to pin 1 of IC206. IC219 is a 
hexadecimal inverter, and the pins 1 and 1 1 
are the output and input of an unused sec- 
tion of this IC."

Figure 3, continued: Notice that some of the diagrams, for example FACTOR, contain them- 
selves in their own definitions. This is known as a recursive definition. 

For instance: 

mem [i]:=mem\j]; 

reads the byte from the memory location / 
and writes it back to memory location /'. 
Machine language subroutines can be called 
from Pascal programs. The statement: 

Call (i); 

can be used to make a call to memory 
address /. 

The P-Machine 

The p-machine is a stack oriented ma- 
chine consisting of four registers and two 
memory storage areas. Memory is separated 
into program storage and data storage areas. 
The program storage area contains the pro- 
gram codes (p-codes), and remains un- 

changed during program execution. The 
data storage area contains the values of 
variables. It is also used to store temporary 
values during arithmetical and logical 
operations. 

Though the variables can be fetched and 
stored in a random fashion, the data storage 
area operates as a stack with respect to 
arithmetical and logical operations and run- 
time storage allocation. Arithmetical and 
logical operations are done on the top 
elements of the stack, and the results of 
the operations are pushed back on the 
stack. In this respect, one might call it a 
zero address machine, since operations 
(except store and load instructions, which 
must specify an address) are done without 
reference to any address. Later we will 
discuss the use of the stack during runtime 
storage allocation.

EXPRESSION 

The four registers in the p-machine are 
the program counter, P, which points to 
the next executable instruction in the 
program storage; the instruction register, I, 
which contains the current execution in- 
struction; the stack pointer, T, which points 
to the top of the stack, and the base address 
register, B, which contains the current base 
address. The functions of the first three 
registers should be quite clear from the 
above discussion. The function of register B 
will become clear after we discuss storage 
allocation. 

Each variable in a Pascal procedure has a 

scope and lifetime. The scope of a variable 
is the range within which it can be refer- 
enced. The scope of a Pascal variable is 
simply the procedure block to which it 
belongs. The lifetime of a variable is from 
the time storage is allocated for it to the 
time storage is disallocated. In Pascal, this 
is the time the procedure defining the vari- 
able is activated to the time a return is 
executed by the procedure. This is different 
from the way variables are treated in BASIC, 
where the scope of a variable is the entire 
program and its lifetime the entire execution 
time.

Since procedure activation is strictly a 
first in, last out process, the use of stack is 
an appropriate strategy. When a procedure is 
activated, storage for its local variables is 
allocated on the top of the stack, and is 
disallocated when the procedure is termi- 
nated. Thus the stack contains all the 
variables of the currently active procedures. 
The variables of the last activated procedure 
are on the top of the stack, those of the 
second to last activated procedure next to 
it, and so on. 

Since storage allocation is not static, 
addresses cannot be assigned at compile 
time, but must be calculated at runtime. 
The base register, B, always points to the 
starting location of the segment of the data 
block in the stack. The addresses generated 
by the compiler are not absolute addresses, 
but displacements from some base addresses. 
If the variable is local, then its address is the 
displacement from the current base register 
B; but if the variable is from an outer pro- 
cedure, then the base address for that pro- 
cedure should be calculated, and added to 
the displacement. 

To do this, and to ensure proper pro- 
cedure or function linkage, extra storage 
is allocated on the stack when a procedure 
is activated. Figure 4 shows the various 
quantities present in each of the procedure 
blocks. The function return value is used 
only for function calls, and storage is allo- 
cated for any parameters needed by the 
procedure or function. The base address 
contains the value of the current base 
register B, and the return address contains 
the program return address at the place of 
the call. The functions of the dynamic 
linkage and the static linkage need further 
explanation. 

The dynamic linkage forms a chain 
that reflects the procedure activation history. 
It points back to the base address of the 
procedure that was activated immediately 
before this one. For instance, if procedure A 
calls procedure B, which calls procedure C, 
then the dynamic link chain points from C 
to B, and then to A. It is used to ensure that 
the program returns to its previous state 
when exiting a procedure. In particular, the 
base register B must be loaded with the cor- 
rect base address of the calling procedure. 
This would be easy to do if we follow a step 
through the dynamic link chain. 

The static link, on the other hand, 
reflects the static hierarchical structure of the 
procedures. Each active procedure has a 
link that points to the procedure (also 
active) that immediately contains it. The 
static links actually form a tree, with the

main program block as the root. These links, 
which in general are different from the 
dynamic links, are used to let programs 
have access to the correct base address of 
the variables in an outer procedure, since 
at compiler time, only the static relationship 
among the procedures are known. The com- 
piler therefore generates the pair (static level 
difference, relative displacement from the 
base address) as addresses for variables. The 
calculation of the addresses from these 
pairs would presumably slow down the 
process, but it is a small price to pay for 
nice features like recursive procedure calls.

The P-Codes 

The p-machine has only 1 1 basic instruct- 
ions, which are listed in table 1 . For the sake 
of simplicity and easy handling in this ver- 
sion of the implementation, all instructions 
are four bytes long. The contents of the four 
bytes are as follows: 

byte 1 : op — the operation code, 
byte 2: can be (i) v — static level dif- 
ference. 

or (ii) c — condition code in a jump 

instruction. 

or (iii) 255 — denotes absolute 

addressing. 

or (iv) not used for some instruc- 
tions, 
bytes 3,4: can be (i) d —displacement 
from the base address. 

or (ii) n — numeric constant. 

or (iii) a — address in the p-code 

program. 

The OPR (arithmetic and logical opera- 
tions) and CSP (call standard procedure) 
are further subdivided into more instructions. 
The complete set of instruction mnemonics 
and operations is listed in table 2. The 
LODX and STOX instructions are used to 
load and store array elements with the value 
of the array subscript on top of the stack. 
The call standard procedure (CSP) instruc- 
tion is primarily used for input and output 
(10) operations. Besides the basic function 
of inputting and outputting single char- 
acters, additional procedures have been 
implemented to relieve the user from writing 
10 conversion routines in Pascal for numeric 
and hexadecimal numbers. In the future, 
more procedures can be added to handle 
the input and output of other data types 
such as floating point numbers and file 
records for tape or disk. Meanwhile these 
seven instructions are sufficient for conven- 
ient use in writing the bootstrap compiler 
and its related software. 

Readers are urged to read the p-code 
interpreter listing which simulates the 
operations of the p-machine. The program 
statements are straightforward and self- 
explanatory. Familiarity with the p-machine 
instruction set is essential in understanding 
the code generation part of the p-compiler. 

The P-Code Interpreter 

Since the p-machine_ is a hypothetical 
computer, there has to be some method of 
executing the p-codes generated by the 
compiler. There are two simple solutions 
to this problem. One is to write an inter- 
preter which can decode and execute the p- 
codes. The other solution is to write a trans-

lator which can decode the p-codes and 
output equivalent executable machine codes 
for an existing computer. Both methods 
have been used in our compiler system. The 
first method, although it runs slower, is 
good for developing programs because many 
debugging facilities can be implemented in 
the interpreter. The second method is good 
for production programs which may need 
faster execution speed. A p-code to 8080 
machine code translator will be described in 
part 3 of this series. 

The p-code interpreter is made up of two 
major modules: 

• Main program. 

• Procedure which 
machine. 

"simulates the p- 

Every call to the simulator will execute 
one p-machine instruction. Each p-machinc 
instruction cycle can be divided into four 
stages: 

• Fetch a p-code from memory. 

• Increment the program counter. 

• Decode the instruction. 

• Execute the instruction. 

Several global variables are used to hold the 
values of the p-machine registers such as 
program counter, stack pointer, current 
instruction, etc. A one-dimensional array 
represents the data stack. Functional opera- 
tions of the various p-machine instructions 
arc coded directly from the instruction set 
defined in table 2. The main program 
simply initializes the program counter to 
zero and then calls the simulator repeatedly 
to simulate machine execution. This sounds 

simple but not useful, because the user has 
no control of the program during execution 
until it terminates. 

In order to enable user control of an 
executing p-code program, the main program 
must accept commands from the user which 
instruct it to call the simulator a specified 

G: go — Set program counter to zero; initialize other counters; start execution. 

S: single-step — Execute one p-code; display the mnemonics of the next p-code pointed 

by the updated program counter. 
R: run/restart — Start execution from current program counter until the program ends 

or a breakpoint is reached. This command is used to continue execution at a break- 
point. 
B: set breakpoint — A p-code address is entered as a breakpoint after the interpreter 

prompts with a ?. Up to five breakpoints may be set. 
C: clear — All breakpoints previously set are cleared. 
Y; display breakpoint — Display the breakpoints already set. 
X: examine status — Display the values of: current program counter, base address, stack 

pointer, the top two elements of the stack. 
K: stack content — A value is entered as the stack pointer after the interpreter prompts 

with a ?. It will then display the values of six stack elements starting from this stack 

pointer. 
T: trace — Display the address and mnemonics of the 16 p-codes last executed. This 

command is usually applied at a breakpoint. It is used for tracing the logic flow of 

the program. 
E: examine program — A p-code address is entered as a display pointer (DP) after the 

interpreter prompts with a ?. It will then display the mnemonics of the p-code at this 

address. This command and the U and N commands are used for examining the 

p-codes anywhere in the program without altering the current program counter. 
U: up — Decrement the display pointer by one and display the mnemonics of the p-code 

pointed by it. 
N: next — Increment the display pointer by one and display the mnermonics of the 

p-code pointed by it. 
Q: quit — Terminate the interpreter program and return to operating system. 

Table 3: Interpreter commands. All commands for the p-code interpreter are 
single characters. A command is entered after the interpreter prompts the 
user with a > on the video display. Additional information is needed for some 
commands such as breakpoint and stack addresses. On entry to the inter- 
preter it will ask for the starting memory address of p-codes and initialize 
the program counter to zero. On exit it will display the number of p-codes 
executed.

element is represented by (sp). The operands of the OPR instructions are replaced by their results on the stack. The result of the 
six relational operations is I if the test is true and if false. With the exception of single operand OPR instructions, all instruc- 
tions adjust the stack pointer, sp, after execution.

North Star BASIC 

A brief summary of North Star BASIC (version 6, release 3) is given for 
readers not familiar with its particular features. 

Variable names are one or two characters long: an alphabetical character fol- 
lowed optionally by a decimal digit. There are four types of variables: numeric, 
string, array of numeric, and function. The string variables are names postfixed 
by a dollar sign $, while function names are prefixed by FN. Functions (and the 
parameters) are defined by the declaration DEF, and ended by FNEND (for 
multiline function). The parameters in the function definition are local to the 
function, and would not affect variables in the calling program. 

Strings cannot be dimensioned. The DIM declarations for strings declare 
the maximum length of the string variables, not their dimensions. The notation 
A$ (3,5) denotes the substring of A$ from position 3 to 5. Thus if A$=ABCDEFG, 
A$ (3, 5) is the string CDE. This substring expression can be used both on the 
left or righthand side of an assignment statement. 

Multiple statement lines are allowed. Statements within a line are separated 
by either colons, :, or back slashes, V 

Absolute memory locations can be accessed from BASIC programs. The 
function EXAM(I) returns the content of memory at address I; and the instruc- 
tion FILL I, J writes a value of J into memory address I. 

Another feature of North Star BASIC is its ability to read from or write to 
disk files. The statement OPEN #0, "FNAME" assigns disk file "FNAME" to file 
unit #0. A subsequent READ #0,A$ reads AS from the disk file, and a WRITE 
#0,A$ writes A$ to the disk file. A built-in function TYP can be used to check 
the type of data to be read. It has a value of when the end of file is reached. 

Listing I : Pascal source code for the p-code interpreter as output by the 
authors' system. This version implements all of the commands in table 3. 

number of times or to display register and 
stack contents. This is the simple idea of a 
debugging interpreter. The debugging aids 
commonly known include single step execu- 
tion, set and reset of breakpoints, and dis- 
play of register and stack contents. A num- 
ber of these debugging facilities have been 
incorporated in the p-code interpreter. 
Table 3 shows the 13 interpreter commands 
and their functions. Note that the trace 
command is particularly useful in analyzing 
mysterious logic flow of a program, such as 
discovering the path along which a break- 
point is reached. This command is more con- 
venient to use and much faster than single 
step execution. The limits on the number of 
breakpoints and the number of instructions 
traced can be changed easily in the program. 
The first version of the p-code interpreter 
was written in BASIC. While developing the 
p-compiler, different constructs of Pascal 
statements were tested one at a time using 
the interpreter to verify the correctness of 
the p-codes generated. After the compiler 
was debugged, the interpreter was rewritten 
in Pascal. The program logic is very similar 
to the BASIC version. Since the program

structure of the Pascal version is neat and 
highly readable, the debugging time is 
minimal. The Pascal source program is 
shown in listing 1. The program design is 
rather straightforward. Readers with some 
programming experience in any high level 
language should be able to read and under- 
stand it without the help of a flowchart or 
further explanation on program logic. Note 
that in the main program and procedure 
exec, the case. ..of statement is put to good 
use. In the BASIC version the interpreter 
commands have to be tested within a FOR 
loop by comparing the input character with 
a string array, and then an ON. ..GOTO state- 
ment is used to branch to various parts of 
the program. 

It must be emphasized again that the 
interpreter executes p-codes and not Pascal 
statements. Therefore the user is required 
to have some knowledge of the p-machine 
and p-codes. In addition to this, the p- 
compiler should be instructed to list p- 
codes together with Pascal program state- 
ments during compilation. They will be 
cross-referenced when running the inter- 
preter. Obviously this procedure is not as 
convenient and easy to use as an ordinary 
BASIC interpreter, but still it provides the 
only way for debugging Pascal programs in 
our present version. A new debugging 
scheme is being planned for the future which 
will enable the user to debug programs 
at the Pascal statement level. This means 
the user may refer to variables and arrays 
and statements rather than stack contents 
and p-code addresses. Part 2 will go into 
details of the design and implementation of 
the p-compiler."

Figure 1: Two types of 
matrices used in graphics 
applications. P represents a 
point in space. The matrix 
C contains equations to 
relate the transformed 
values of X, Y, and Z to 
the original values. 

One definition of graphics might be "a 
means to convert data into information." 
Our computers create printed data at a great 
rate, but all this data is not information until 
it conveys to a person some trend or fact 
about the world we live in. A small part of 
graphics is the conversion of data represent- 
ing the position in space of the surface of 
an object into a three-dimensional picture 
of that object. The picture may be useful 
for itself as computer art, or it may help 
understand something about the object. 

Imagine looking down the length of a 
pencil, using only one eye. With the eraser 
held away from the viewer, the pencil 
appears as a polygon with a dark place in 
the center where the lead is. The length of 
the pencil and the eraser are invisible. Now 
imagine the pencil rotated about its point 
until it is pointed toward the viewer's 
shoulder. The length of the pencil and the 
eraser are now visible, and appear in the 
form of translations to the side and up of 
the surface of the pencil. The relation 
between the position of a point on the 
pencil, specified in three dimensions X, Y 
and Z, and the apparent translation of that 
point as the pencil is rotated is expressed by 
standard equations. These can be written in 
an organized fashion using matrices. These 
matrices are called coordinate transform 
matrices. They are powerful tools because 
they separate the mathematics associated 
with the angle of observation from the 
data describing the surface of an object. 
The small computers available today make 
it easy to convert surface data to pictorial 
information using matrices. This article 
will show how. 

Definitions 

The Cartesian coordinate system will be 
used in this discussion. On a computer 
graphic screen, X is the horizontal dimen- 
sion, Y is defined as the vertical dimen- 

sion, and Z is depth into the screen. Pos- 
itive values are to the right, up, and away 
from the viewer. The origin will usually be in 
the center of the screen. A plane is de- 
scribed by any two axes. Thus, the X,Y 
plane is the surface of the computer screen, 
the Y,Z plane is seen edge on as the Y axis, 
and the X,Z plane is seen edge on as the X 
axis. 

An equation which does not specifically 
include a particular coordinate direction will 
be interpreted to mean that the described 
line or point may exist anywhere along the 
unmentioned axis. Thus, X=1 represents 
the entire Y,Z plane located at 1 along the 
X axis. The line defined by Y=X may exist 
anywhere along the Z axis; therefore this 
equation defines a plane tilted 45 degrees 
from the horizontal, seen edge on at Z equal 
to zero on the computer screen. A surface 
may be made parallel to an axis by omitting 
that axis, as above, or may be specified at 
all values of X, Y and Z. Thus, Y=X+Z is 
a surface defined for all space. 

Two kinds of matrices will be used here. 
The first kind is a matrix which represents 
the coordinates of a point in space, de- 
scribed by X, Y and Z. This matrix, P, is a 
column matrix, with one column and 
three rows as shown in figure 1. It will 
be used to hold the values for a point 
on the surface, both before and after trans- 
formation. All drawing commands will 
use the X and Y from this matrix. 

The second kind of matrix contains the 
standard equations which relate the trans- 
formed values for X, Y and Z to the original 
values. This matrix, C, has three rows and 
three columns. The numbers at each po- 
sition in this matrix are derived from the 
standard equations for some specific co- 
ordinate transformation type, such as a 
rotation. If the angle of observation of the 
object is arrived at by two successive oper- 
ations, such as a rotation in each of two 
planes, then the matrix, C, which controls 
this view may have numbers in it that are 
derived from two matrix equations. The 
procedure which produces a single matrix 
combining several operations is called matrix 
multiplication. Matrix multiplication is used 
both to produce the particular numbers in 
the 3 by 3 matrix, C, which describe a point 
of observation, and then to apply those 
numbers to derive a transformed 3 by 1 
matrix, P, which gives the apparent position 
of some part of the object's surface. 

Computing Procedure 

Given the ability to do matrix multipli- 
cation (the details will be presented below), 

1 56 September 1978 © BYTE Publications Inc 

the sequence of operations to produce a 
three-dimensional picture of an object is 
short and easily stated: 

1. Generate an array of data consisting 
of the X, Y and Z coordinates of the 
object to be drawn. This may be 
either computed as the drawing pro- 
gresses, or done all at once and stored. 
The latter way is faster if the view- 
point is to be adjusted to find the 
most pleasing picture. 

2. Define the viewpoint. For this part, 
a matrix is generated for each motion 
required to arrive at the desired 
point of view. The matrices are then 
multiplied together to produce a 
single 3 by 3 matrix to be used in the 
main routine. The order of multi- 
plication may be important. 

3. Write a program to draw the object in 
its untransformed state. This will be 
a sequence of commands which move 
the graphic cursor to a spot on the 
object at the beginning of an edge or 
other feature, then draw (move 
leaving a line behind) to another 
spot on the object. Specify the move 
and draw coordinates in terms of a 
column matrix element rather than 
X, Y and Z. Define the elements at 
each spot by using each of the points 
in the array. 

4. When the untransformed picture is 
accurate and understood, then the 
picture is reoriented by simply in- 
serting a matrix multiplication be- 
tween the specification of each col- 
umn matrix and the associated graphic 
command. The original X, Y, Z 
coordinates of the spot on the object 
are thereby transformed into a new 
set of X, Y, Z numbers representing 
the spot seen from the new viewpoint. 
Each set of coordinates from step 1 
is multiplied by the matrix generated 
in step 2. 

4a. An alternate method is to do all the 
transformations at once, changing all 
the X, Y and Z points in the array 
formed in step 1 into transformed X, 
Y and Z numbers in the same array. 

Since the computer screen is really only 
two-dimensional, only the X and Y elements 
are used in step 3. After transformation, 
these numbers are shifted about and contain 
depth information. The drawing made in this 
fashion is a projected view rather than a 
three-dimensional drawing. The difference is 
that in the projected view sides which are 
parallel on the object remain parallel in the 

projected view, but in the three-dimensional 
view all lines converge at infinity along the Z 
axis. The difference is minor. The observer 
perceives a three-dimensional picture in most 
cases; the projected view in some figures is 
perceived either as having relief or depth 
without the visual clue of lines meeting at 
infinity. This leads to some interesting 
optical illusions using projected views. 
The rest of this article discusses some of 
the transformations available and shows the 
pictorial results of each. 

Matrix Multiplication 

What information is necessary to write a subroutine to perform the 
matrix transformations described in this article? The general theory of 
matrix algebra and its interpretation is beyond the scope of this dis- 
cussion. For more information and a very clear description of many 
other uses for matrices, the reader is referred to The Mathematics of 
Matrices by Philip J Davis. Here are some brief notes on the subject: 

Two aspects of matrices are important in matrix multiplication. 
These are the order of the matrices being multiplied (which one comes 
first), and the shape of each matrix. The elements in the output matrix 
resulting from a multiplication of two matrices are each formed by 
combining numbers in the columns of the first matrix and rows of the 
second matrix, done in a standard order. All the necessary rows and 
columns have to exist for the output to exist. Thus, some matrices 
may be multiplied in one order, but not in the opposite order. The rule 
is: the number of columns of the first matrix must equal the number 
of rows of the second matrix. 

In table I , the two matrices may be multiplied in the order (C) (P) 
but not in the order (P) (C). The result of multiplying (C) (P) is a new 
column matrix P '. A mathematician would say that two matrices are 
"conformable for multiplication" when the order and shape require- 
ments are met. He would also say "(C) is multiplied by (P)" here. The 
requirement for conformability leaves one dimension of the shape of 
each matrix unrestricted. The unrestricted dimensions establish the 
shape of the output matrix. Tables J and 2 summarize the necessary 
arithmetic. The elements in (C) are numbers, which are each computed 
in various ways depending upon the desired transformation.

Types of Transformations 

The operations possible using coordi- 
nate transform matrices are not limited 
to shifting and rotating the picture. A 
number of more drastic changes may be 
made to the picture. Some of these 
changes are: magnification, shear, stretch- 
ing in one direction, and mapping onto a 
surface. 

The following figures and tables show 
examples of several coordinate transform 
operations. Each operation is represented 
by the matrix, the equations for the out- 
put matrix elements, and a figure to show 
how a picture of a well-known object is 
changed by the operation. 

Unit Matrix 

Table 3 shows the unit matrix. This trans- 
formation reproduces the picture of the 
object in its original view as defined above.

Scaling 

The object may be defined with some 
shape which is not quite the final version, 
but which uses easily verified dimensions. 
Thus, in our example, the height is equal to 
the diameter, and the square outline in 
figure 2 quickly shows that the array of data 
defining the cup is correct in the X and Y 
dimensions. 

Selective magnification along any axis 
may be used to alter the proportions of 
the object to a shape that may be nearer 
that required by the user. Thus, table 4 and 
figure 3 are appropriate for users with large 
capacities; table 5 and figure 4 produce a 
cup for those with wide mouths, while 
table 6 and figure 6 produce a cup which 
could be used for filling a pie plate with 
whipped cream. 

If the proportions are correct but the 
user wants to create several different sizes, 
table 7 will allow the same magnification to 
take place along all the axes. One such 
magnified cup is shown in figure 5.

Shear 

The object in its original shape may be 
boring and conventional in shape and lack 
individuality. This failing may be rectified as 
in table 8 and figure 7. To shear the object, 
the position of a point on the object is dis- 
placed from its original position by a func- 
tion of the point's position along an ortho- 
gonal axis. These figures displace the points 
upward by a value equal to half the hori- 
zontal distance to each point. 

Table 9 and figures 8 and 9 show shear 
along the horizontal axis. Figure 9 shows the 
same object as figure 8 rotated 90° to illus- 
trate that the third axis is unchanged by this 
operation. As in the other operations, shears 
along all axes may be combined.

Rotations 

The object may be reoriented in space by 
rotating it about any axis. A particular angle 
of view may be arrived at by some sequence 
of rotations about each axis. This is easily 
accomplished using the matrices in the fol- 
lowing tables. 

A point of confusion occurs when using 
rotations. The order of multiplication of the 
matrices (or the order of applying the opera- 
tions to the object) is important. The axes 
remain associated with the object, not the 
screen. This means, for instance, that if Ihc 
rotation in the X, Y plane shown in table 10 
is applied first to the object, then subse- 
quent rotations in the other planes happen 
in the slanted planes (X,Z and Y,Z) shown in 
figure 10. 

It required some care to accurately pre- 
dict the final picture after several rotations, 
especially since projected views lack the 
visual clue due to lines converging at infinity. 
Tables 11 and 12 along with figures 11 and 
12 show the effects of rotation in the other 
two planes.

Translation 

Figure 14: Rotated and sheared. 

Translation 

Moving the object sideways is not shown 
but is accomplished by adding the transla- 
tion value to the original value for each axis 
as shown in table 14. 

Figure 15: Rotated but not sheared. 

Mapping 

All of the examples shown so far have 
applied the same operation to every point 
on the surface of the object. The coordinate 
transform matrix contains the same numbers 
for all parts of the object. A more compli- 
cated operation results when the value (X,Y, 
Z) associated with a point on the surface 
of the object is replaced by a function of X, 
Y, and Z at each point. The result maps the 
object onto some surface. Thus, if X is 
replaced by sin(X), for instance, the object 
will experience a change in scale which 
changes with X, and the output position of a 
point on the object which has a value of X 
equal to zero, and an arbitrary Y and Z is 
the same as a point with a value of X equal 
to 180 or 360 if the computer interprets the 
value of X as degrees. 

The result of replacing X by sin(X) pic- 
torially is identical to the projected view of 
a cylinder, parallel to the Y axis, which has 
the original view (such as figure 2) painted 
onto its surface. If the dimensions of the 
object for this example are such that the 
width is equal to 360 units, then the cylin- 
der is completely circumscribed by the 
original view of the object. 

In order to make a three-dimensional 
picture of the mapped figure, the other 
two dimensions must also be specified. 
For the example here, the depth must also 
be mapped by setting Z equal to cos(X). 
Since the new surface is a cylinder, Y is

Mapping Example 

Figure 16 shows a label to be pasted on 
the coffee cup. This label, like the cup 
itself, is defined by an array of data giving 
the X, Y and Z coordinates of each point. 
The standard view is in the Z equal to zero 
plane. A subroutine then replaces the X and 
Z values with the mapped values in all the 
points of the array. Since the standard view 
of the cup is a side view, and the label is 
to be pasted opposite the handle, 180° is 
added to X before computing the mapped 
functions. The lower left corner of figure 16 
is coordinate (0,0). 

The mapped array of data is now sub- 
jected to whatever coordinate transforms are 
applied to the cup. Figure 17 shows the 
result as applied to the label alone. Figure 
18 shows the completed picture.

Figure 1 9 shows the same object as figure 
1 8, rotated 1 80°. While most viewers see the 
cup with the handle toward them, "looking 
down into it" in figure 18, many find that 
figure 19 alternates between looking down 
ifito it with the handle away from the 
viewer, and looking up at it from the bot- 
tom, with the handle at the top. This exam- 
ple shows that a relatively minor change in 
viewpoint may produce a great change in 
terms of the clarity of the information 
presented.

Mapping Uses 

Mapping may be used to compress the 
picture of an object to fit it into a particular 
space, to selectively emphasize some part 
while compressing the rest, such as the re- 
gion near X equal to zero or 180° in this 
example. Or it may be used to picture some 
complicated configuration which is more 
easily defined in a rectangular coordinate 
system. Thus, a simple rectangular electrode 
configuration expressed in Cartesian coordi- 
nates may be used to compute the electric 
field lines at each point in the configuration. 
Mapping processes plus the coordinate 
transforms may then be used to change the 
known field picture into one for a compli- 
cated electron gun in a cathode ray tube. 

Excerpts from the BASIC program 
which produced the pictures in this 
article are shown in listing 1. The 
machine used is a Tektronix 405 J graphic 
computer with a 4662 plotter, with 
matrix read only memory. The matrix 
command A MPY B is specific to this 
equipment. The rest of the program is In 
a fairly standard BASIC. 

Lines 2000 to 2490 comprise the 
main program which draws the coffee 
cup. The purpose of each subroutine is 
noted. The program defining the various 
matrices in terms of viewpoint parameters 
is shown in lines 2535 to 3010. The 
program to combine the matrices into a 
single 3 by 3 matrix, C4, which is applied 
to the drawing is listed in lines 3120 to 
3200. The A MPY B format does the 
matrix multiplication. In a machine 
without this extension, a subroutine using 
the equation listed in the various figures 
would do the same job, but take much 
more space. 

Lines 4000 to 4300 show part of 
the much longer listing which defines 
the cup: Al (N,l) = X, Al (N,2) = Y, 
A 1 (N,3) = Z. The variable A 1 (N,4) is 
a secondary address used with a form 
of the print command to make it move 
(21) or draw (20). This is a faster way 
to draw on the Tektronix machine. 
Lines 4050 to 4140 draw the top and 
bottom circle. 

Lines 5240 to 5270 convert the cup 
dimensions to graphics display units 
(GDUs) which are required to use this 
style of drawing commands. This pro- 
gram, with all arrays, filled, uses about 
28,500 bytes of memory. Incidentally, 
lacking a printer, I printed the program 
using the plotter.

WADUZITDO: 

How To Write a Language in 256 Words or Less 

Larry Kheriaty 

Computer Center 

Western Washington University 

Bellingham WA 98225 

Every computer owner likes to show his 
or her microcomputer to friends. The first 
question the friends usually ask is, "What 
does it do?" The software system presented 
here demonstrates what a computer can do 
in a manner simple enough for almost any- 
one to understand. Even if you have a larger, 
more capable system, it is often worth- 
while to be able to demonstrate something 
that can be accomplished on a smaller scale. 
WADUZITDO is small enough to run on 
almost any microcomputer yet it allows 
even the novice user to make the computer 
"do something." 

WADUZITDO is a complete high level 
language processor that fits in less than 
256 bytes on either a 6800 or 8080 based 
system. The only other requirement is some 
kind of terminal. The system includes a 
text editor to allow a program to be entered 
and modified, and an interpreter to exe- 
cute the program. The only external rou- 
tines needed are single character input and 
single character output such as those pro- 
vided by most system monitors. 

The object of WADUZITDO is to run 
simple conversational programs. There are 
just five statement types, roughly derived 
from the PILOT language. To keep it small 
only the most essential capabilities are 
available. This also makes programming very 
easy. In fact, only a few minutes after my 
unsuspecting spouse had asked, "What does 
it do?", she had written the interactive 
dialogue program in listing 1 to help me 
make out a list of acceptable birthday gifts! 

Programming in WADUZITDO is straight- 
forward and uncomplicated. For example, 
to direct the computer to display a line of 
text on the terminal you use the type state- 
ment. The following example shows the for- 
mat of the type statement. 

T:WHAT COULD BE EASIER 
THAN THIS? 

The T is the operation code for type. A 
colon always follows the operation code. 

The text after the colon is displayed exactly 
as shown. 

The accept statement allows the program 
to receive one input character from the 
terminal keyboard. Normally it is used after 
a type that asks for a response. For example: 

T:CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT 2 + 3 
EQUALS? 

The accept statement is just the A opera- 
tion code followed by a colon. When it is en- 
countered execution pauses until the user 
keys in any single character. Then the input- 
character is saved internally for use in sub- 
sequent match statements. 

The match statement is used to test the 
character entered by the user on the previ- 
ous accept. Match is coded as an M (the op- 
eration code), followed by a colon and one 
character. The character in the statement is 
compared to the last character entered by 
the user. The result of the comparison is re- 
corded internally in the match flag: Y if the 
match is equal, N if it is not equal. 

Once set the match flag can be used to 
conditionally execute or skip any subse- 
quent statement. This is done by placing 
either a Y (yes) or N (no) immediately 
before any operation code. If the Y or 
N is the same as the match flag the state- 
ment is executed, otherwise it is skipped. 
An elaboration of the previous example 
illustrates the use of match . 

T:WHAT IS 2 + 3? 

A: 

M:5 

YT:FIVE, RIGHT. 

NT:NO,THE ANSWER IS 5. 

Normally statements are executed se- 

166 September 1978 © BYTE Publications Inc 

quentially. The jump statement is used to 
alter the normal sequence. The format of the 
jump statement is J, followed by a colon, 
and a number from zero to nine. The state- 
ment J:0 causes a branch back to the last 
accept statement executed. Execution 
resumes from that statement. The J:0 
statement can be used to allow the user to 
reanswer a previous question. For example: 

T:HOW MANY FEET IN A YARD? 

M:3 

YT:RIGHT. 

NT:WRONG STUPID, TRY AGAIN. 

Nj:0 

The second form of the jump makes use of 
program markers. A program marker is an 
asterisk, *, preceding any statement. The 
statement J:n, where n is a number from 
1 to 9, causes a branch to the nth program 
marker forward from the jump. This form of 
the jump is shown in the sample program in 
listing 2 which plays NIM. 

The last type of statement is stop. This 
statement merely terminates execution of 
the program and returns control to the pro- 
gram editor. The format of the stop state- 
ment is S: 

To increase the versatility of the language 
the S: statement can, at the user's option, 
be made to call a user written machine 
language subroutine from within the 
WADUZITDO program. To do this requires 
a one statement modification to the system 
which is detailed below. If you choose to 
make this modification you can consider 
S: to be the operation code tor subroutine 
rather than stop. The format of the sub- 
routine statement is S:x where x is any 
single character which serves as a parameter 
to the user written program. The value x will 
be stored in register A in both the 6800 and 
8080 version. It can be used to select dif- 
ferent functions to be performed by the 
program. 

During execution any statement which 
does not fit the syntax of one of the five 
statement types is printed in its entirety, 
then execution resumes normally with the 
next statement. Table 1 summarizes the 
WADUZITDO instruction set. 

When WADUZITDO is first entered con-

line should be no longer than the line it 
replaces. If it is longer, the next line of text 
is also overwritten. End the replacement line 

with a percent key rather than a carriage 
return. The % causes null characters to be 
stored as filler up to the start of the next 
line. To begin execution of the program 
enter a dollar sign, $. (The editing com- 
mands are summarized in table 2.) 

If you already have a good text editor in 
your system it may be used instead of 
the one included. Each statement is variable 
length, terminated by a carriage return 
character. All other control characters 
between statements are ignored. 

Complete 6800 and 8080 assembly list- 
ings containing source and object code are 
included to simplify implementation on 
your system. The 6800 version in listing 3 
uses the MIKBUG monitor; the 8080 version 
in listing 4 uses the SOLOS/CUTER moni- 
tor. If you have one of these two system 
monitors you need not modify the program 
at all. 

The entry point to the system is at loca- 
tion zero. Upon entry the stack pointer is 
assumed set to address some scratchpad 
memory area large enough to accommodate 
a few levels of call. In MIKBUG or SOLOS/ 
CUTER, as with most system monitors, this 
is handled automatically by the GO or 
EXEC command. The 2 byte value stored in 
LOC (hexadecimal 100) must point to the 
place where the user program is to be 
stored. In the assembly listings note that this 
value is shown as hexadecimal 01 06, the first 
location not occupied by the system. 

If you don't have one of the above 
monitors you must supply character input 
and character output routines and change 
the references to IN and OUT to address 
these routines. In the listings you will find 
one reference to IN and one to OUT which 
needs to be changed. If your terminal 
requires a delay after each carriage return 
you can set the number of null padding 
characters by a one byte modification to 
the statement labeled PLF. 

Any of the special characters used by the 
text editor ($, %, \, I, bs) can be easily 
changed to another more convenient charac- 
ter on your keyboard. 

As shown in the assembly listings the S: 
statement halts execution by branching to 
the text editor. If you don't modify this you 
can treat it as a stop statement. To use it as a 
subroutine call you must modify the J MP 
SUB instruction to be a JSR or CALL 
(depending on the system) to the appropri- 
ate address. Upon entry to the subroutine

PAPERBYTE tm Bar Codes for 
WADUZITDO 

In figure 7 and figure 2, we provide 
a PAPERBYTE tm bar code represen- 
tation for the WADUZITDO programs 
of listing 3 and listing 4. These bar 
code representations were created in 
the absolute loader format docu- 
mented in detail in the PAPER BYTE 
book, Bar Code Loader, written by 
Ken Budnlck of Micro-Scan Asso- 
ciates, and available for $2 at local 
computer stores or by mail (add $. 75 
postage and handling) from BITS Inc, 
25 Route 101 W, Peterborough NH 
03458.

Listing 4, continued: 

Text continued from page 168 

the index register (6800) or HL register 
pair (8080) contains the location of the 
next program statement and should be saved 
and restored before returning from the 
subroutine. In the 8080 version the DE 
register pair should also be saved. Register A 
will contain the one character parameter, x, 
of the S:x. Its use is totally up to the 
subroutine. 

The system has been organized so that 
the six bytes of changeable data are iso- 
lated from the read only portion. This means 
the rest of the 256 byte system could be 
placed in read only memory. It would fit 
in a single 1702AEROM chip. 

It is easy to see how this language could 
be used to write a question and answer con- 
versation using multiple choice or true, 
false answers. It may not be so obvious that 
more complex logic is possible. The example 
in listing 2 is a computer versus user NIM 
game which demonstrates a way this can 
be done. 

Although WADUZITDO is not the 
ultimate answer to personal computing, it 
is something that almost anyone can have 
some fun with, and it definitely squeezes the 
most out of 256 bytes of memory. 

A Pascal WADUZITDO 

Notes by Ray Cote 
Program by Larry Kheriaty 

Along with the assembly language ver- 
sions of WADUZITDO, Larry Kheriaty sent 
us the Pascal version shown in listing 5. The 
program is basically self-documenting and 
very easy to translate into assembly level 
programs for any particular processor. The 
program is indented to show logical relation- 
ships between related areas of text. This is 
sometimes known as prettyprinting. 

The first four lines of the program are 
definition lines for the main program. In 
Pascal, all variables must be defined com- 
pletely at the start of the section in which 
they are used. "Completely" means name and 
data type. This is a great help since all var- 
iables must be explicitly defined. You can 
easily check to see what type of variable is 
being used. 

WADUZITDO uses two types of var-

iables: integer and character. There is also 
a definition for constants (CONST). CONST 
informs the compiler that the value being 
assigned to this variable will not change. 
Integer variables will only take on whole 
number values. 

The type character (CHAR) means that 
the variables will take on the values of 
ASCII characters, including all letters, num- 
bers and special symbols. 

The last line of the definition section de- 
fines a variable PROG as an array of charac-

ters. This definition also states that the rel- 
ative base address of the array will be unity 
and the variable PZ will be used to specify 
locations within the array. 

After defining our variables we are ready 
to start the first executable part of the pro- 
gram. In Pascal, the logical parts of the pro- 
gram are broken into procedures, equivalent 
to subroutines in languages such as FOR- 
TRAN. Every procedure is blocked off by 
BEGIN and END statements. The name of 
the first procedure is CHIN. After we have 
determined the name, we are told to begin 
executing procedure ACCEPT (which will 
return to us input values in variable CBUF). 
This is a subroutine which is not shown 
since it is specific to the processor being 
used. The next two procedures are also 
calls to subroutines used to DISPLA Y the 
contents of the buffer and move the output 
to a new line. These two procedures are also 
machine dependent. Notice that Pascal 
allows you to use descriptive names. This is 
very important when writing a program 
that you want other people to read or that 
you want to understand at a later date. 

The next procedure, LIST, first defines 
its own local variables, which it will use 
only within the LIST routine. As before, the 
procedure is delimited by BEGIN and END 
statements. This procedure introduces us to 
the concept of loops. Here we have a related 
pair of commands: REPEA T and UNTIL. 
These two commands cause the one line of 
three instructions and the call to procedure 
CHOUT to execute until either the value I Is 
greater than 64 or the variable CBUF is 
equal to CEOL. Once either of these two 
conditions occurs, the program logic pro- 
ceeds to call procedure NEWLINE. At this 
point the LIST procedure ends and returns 
to whatever procedure called it. 

Procedure EXECUTE looks structurally 
the same as procedure LIST. There is a def- 
inition of variables, the BEGIN and END 
delimiters, and a REPEAT-UNTIL struc- 
ture. This time the REPEAT-UNTIL state- 
ment is not waiting for a relation to be 
true, but is rather checking against one var- 
iable. Looking at how DONE was defined 
at the beginning of the procedure, we see 
that its designation is BOOLEAN. This 
means that the variable is being used as a 
logical variable and can take on the value 
true or false. The REPEAT-UNTIL instruc- 
tion waits to see If the variable DONE is 
true. If so, we have finished this procedure 
and can stop it. 

174 September 1978 O BYTE Publications Inc 

Procedure EXECUTE also contains an IF- 
THEN-ELSE statement, if the value of 
CBUF is not contained within the brackets, 
perform procedure LIST. If the value of 
CBUF is somewhere within the square 
brackets, we want to perform an operation 
related to that value. We now come to 
another Pascal instruction, the CASE state- 
ment. 

We are given a set of cases to choose 
from. The CASE statement tells us that we 
will be using the value in variable CBUF to 
determine what is to be done. We scan down 
each of the cases and find the one labeled 
with the value in CBUF. Since CBUF is 
type character we are looking at ASCII 
characters. Once we find the value of CBUF 
we execute the statements associated with it 
that are blocked off by another set of 
BEGIN and END statements. After we 
have finished, we move to the end of the 
CASE statement and then the last line of 
REPEA T-UNT/L statement. 

The next section of the program does not 
look like the preceding sections. It does not 
start with a PROCEDURE statement, but 
has a BEGIN statement. So far we have dis- 
cussed procedures. Any of the procedures 
that needed to use variables have defined 
their own. So why did we define those var- 
iables at the very beginning of the program? 
The reason is not to use them in a pro- 
cedure, but to use them in the main pro- 
gram. This BEGIN statement is nothing 
more than the start of the mainline logic for 
program WADUZITDO. The mainline logic 
inputs characters and either stores them in 
an array as program or executes them as 
commands. This routine will not jump out 
of the loop and will have to be interrupted 
to stop. Of course it is possible to create 
another command that will allow you to 
exit from this cycle. 

Now that we have looked at the Pascal 
version of WADUZITDO, the reader should 
refer back to either of the assembly versions. 
The Pascal version performs the same func- 
tion as the assembly versions. 

The assembly language versions need to 
be heavily commented for the reader to 
understand what is happening. Even liberal 
comments will not help when converting 
from one assembly language to another. 
The Pascal version can be easily converted 
into any machine language. It is also self- 
documenting. Notice that even without a 
single comment, the Pascal listing is extreme- 
ly easy to decipher. . . . RGAC"

Is It a Plot? 

Here is one of the most exciting 
peripherals available for the personal 
computer user who is interested in 
graphic arts applications: a very afford- 
able ($1085) digital plotter from 
Houston Instrument called the Hi 
Plot. The statistics on this machine 
are impressive to say the least. The 
resolution of the pen tip is either .005 
inch or 0.01 inch giving a total of 1400 
by 2000 picture elements or 700 by 
1000 picture elements respectively in its 
7 by 10 inch (17.8 cm by 25.4 cm) plot- 
ting area. Standard ink cartridges are 
available in four colors, allowing the user 
to switch cartridges to produce mixed 
color plots. According to Tom Hall of 
Houston Instrument it is also possible 
for the individual user to kludge a stan- 
dard drafting ink pen into the plotter, 
allowing a much wider selection of 
colors to be used in the form of per- 
sonally chosen inks. 

Many of the plotting samples seen in 
this issue should be reproducible by the 
small system owner who uses this peri- 
pheral, a typical personal system with a 
high level language and floppy disks, and 
some imagination. 

Complete and ready to plot, the Hi 
Plot costs $1085. Contact Houston 
Instrument, One Houston Square, Austin 
TX 78753.*

Photo J: The new Houston Instrument's Hi Plot plotter is shown here in a typical analytical 
situation: plotting a polar coordinate function in the plane of the paper with Cartesian axes for 
reference. 

Photo 2: The interface to the user's computer is via a standard DB-25 connector located 
on the lower edge of the rear panel of the plotter.

MASS STORAGE 

Micropolis Announces Double Sided Floppy Disk Drives 

Double sided floppy disk drives are 
now available on two of Micropolis 
Corp's OEM series. The company's Mega- 
Floppy series, Models 1015 and 1055, 

features an intelligent controller that fa- 
cilitates interconnection of four subsys- 
tems to a common host interface for a 
total on line storage capacity of more 

than 15 M bytes. 

The 1015 is an unpackaged drive 
designed to integrate floppy disk storage 
into a system enclosure. This series 
is expanded to four products of double 
sided options. Storage capacity ranges 
from 143 K bytes to 630 K bytes 
per drive. The Model 1015's file space 
may be optionally expanded up to 
946 K bytes by using the Micropolis 
intelligent controller and group code 
recording (GCR) method. The 5V* inch 
floppy offers GCR and a microproc- 
essor based controller as standard fea- 
tures. Model 1055 has four soft sectored 
formats for each of its 77 tracks, yield- 
ing a maximum capacity of 1892 K 
bytes of useable file space on its double 
sided version. An optional add on mod- 
ule, comprised of two read and write 
heads and two drives sharing a common 
controller, increases the subsystem for- 
matted capacity to 3784 K bytes. 

The 35 track configuration single 
drive, double sided 1015 Model III with 
287 K bytes of formatted capacity is 
priced at $330 in quantities of 500. A 
quad density version, the 1015 Model 
IV, which has 77 tracks per surface and a 
track density of 100 tracks per inch with 
up to 946 K bytes formatted capacity, is 
$396. The Micropolis intelligent control- 
ler is a $369 option on the quad density 
version when purchased in quantities of 
500. The Model 1055 Model IV. which 
includes the intelligent controller, power 
supply, bidirectional interface, enclosure 
and almost 2 M bytes of on line capa- 
city, is priced at $1796 in quantities of 
50. For further information, contact 
Micropolis Corp, 3959 Deering Av, 
Canoga Park CA 91304."

This new stand alone intelligent 
controller, the PerSci Model 1170, is 
capable of managing either single or 
double density recording on as many as 
32 diskette sides for a total system for- 
matted data capacity of 16 M bytes. 

The controller is a compact computer 
for use in diskette subsystem manage- 
ment and microcomputer applications. It 
uses microprocessor intelligence to 
communicate by file name and to 
assume the housekeeping functions 

usually performed by the processor. 
File management functions include 
initialization; allocation and deallocation 
of diskette space; error detection and 
retry; creating, deleting, renaming, 
copying of files; and diagnostic testing. 

Designed to operate PerSci's recently 
introduced Model 299 drive, the 1170 
is also capable of handling two PerSci 
Model 277 dual diskette drives or various 
combinations of Models 299 and 277. 

The price is $800 in large quantities. 

Improved System Disk for System 88 

PolyMorphic Systems has announced 
a seocnd system software edition for 
their System 88 microcomputers, mak- 
ing them faster and easier to use. The 
software includes an enhanced operat- 
ing system, BASIC, text editor and 
assembler. 

Added to the BASIC language are 
string arrays and array commands that 
allow the user to create and manipulate 
labels for tables and charts, mailing lists, 
personnel records, inventory, and billing, 
and so on. For the scientific user, BASIC 
now has inverse trigonometric, hyper- 
bolic and gamma functions. Also in- 
cluded are new statistical functions that 
simplify data reduction. 

The System 88 text editor now per- 
mits the user to move, copy, or delete an 
entire block of text. Cursor movements 
are now two-dimensional; the original 
cursor movements have been retained. 
For further information, contact Poly- 
Morphic Systems, 460 Ward Dr, Santa 
Barbara CA 93111."

MEMORY 

Battery Backup for Memory Board 

Ampex MCM-8080 Core Memory Board Building Block for Cartridge Memories 

This 16 K byte core memory for 
8080 microcomputers is now available 
from Ampex Corp, 200 N Nash St, El 
Segundo CA 90245. Fully compatible 
with SBC 80 single board computers, the 
MCM-8080 provides nonvolatile storage 
for 16 K bytes with a data access time 
within 325 ns. The read and write cycle 
times are 780 and 1240 ns, respectively. 

Each memory board includes elec- 
tronics to detect input DC power condi- 
tions and inhibit operation when out of 
tolerance. The microcomputer is a pin 
compatible alternative to the SBC 016, 
SBC 046, SBC 416 and MDS 016 mem- 
ory boards used with Intel SBC 80/05, 
80/10 and 80/20 or equivalent com- 
puters. It can be used to provide up to 
64 K bytes of addressable locations for 
either 8 bit or 16 bit applications. 

The board measures 12 by 6.75 by 
0.50 inches (30.48 by 17.14 by 1.27 cm) 
and utilizes the +5 V and +12 V power 
available. Single unit price is $885."

C1-6800 Microprocessor Memory 

The microprocessor memory C1- 
6800 is a 16,384 word, 8 bit dynamic 
random access* memory. The memory 
module plugs directly into the EXOR- 
ciser and is plug compatible with the 
Mex-6812, 6815, 6816-1. Through the 
use of the 16,384 by 1 bit NMOS 
dynamic memory parts the memory 
module capacity can be increased up to 
64 K bytes on a single board. An access 
time of 300 ns accompanied with on 
board hidden refresh permits maximum 
utilization of processor speed. The 
memory is addressable as a contiguous 
block in 4 K word increments thru 64 K. 
The on board dual in line package switch 
assigns the addresses for customer 
configuration. Prices are $390 for 16 K 
by 8 and $1230 for 64 K by 8. Contact 
Chrislin Industries Inc, 31312 Via 
Colinas #102, Westlake Village CA

The Model 650 cartridge transport 
from North Atlantic's Qantex Division, 
200 Terminal Dr, Plainview NY 11803, 
is designed as an original equipment 
manufacturer (OEM) memory building 
block for instruments, word processors, 
data processing systems for small busi- 
nesses and other computer based equip- 
ment. The unit lists singly for $475, 
complete with "intimate electronics," 
stores up to 23 million bits of unfor- 
matted digital data on the four tracks of 
a DC300A tape cartridge. Optical 
tachometer holds tape speed at 30 inches 
per second for read and write operations, 
giving 48 K bps data transfer rate at 
1600 bpi recording density. Tape is 
accelerated to 90 inches per second for 
rewind and fast search, permitting any 
stored data to be accessed in about 20 
seconds. The transport can also be 
supplied with read after write heads for 
data validation during the actual 
recording process."

Two static programmable memory 
boards capable of battery backup and 
compatible with Intel's SBC 80/05, 
SBC 80/10 and SBC 80/20 have been 
announced by Electronic Solutions Inc, 
7969 Engineer Rd, San Diego CA 92111. 
The two versions are the RAM-4L con- 
taining 4 K bytes of memory and the 
RAM-8L containing 8 K bytes of mem- 
ory. The RAM-8L uses a single 5 V 
power supply and draws 1.2 A typical, 
1.7 A maximum under operation. During 
battery backup at 1.7 V, the battery cur- 
rent is 0.5 A typical, 0.8 A maximum. 
Thr ; ee alkaline D cell batteries can back 
up 8 K bytes of memory for 11 hours, 
according to the company. The RAM-4L 
is priced at $312 and the RAM-8L is 
$428."

Non-Volatile High Speed Semiconductor Programmable Memory 

The ElectriCom 4020 is a single card 
memory designed to meet the require- 
ments for short and long term non- 
volatile high speed programmable 
memory systems. Memory data is main- 
tained for a minimum of 3 months (6 
months typical) after the primary board 
power is removed. The long data reten- 
tion time allows the 4020 to be used for 
high speed program and data files that 
may be removed and stored away from 
the host processor. On-board nickel- 
cadmium batteries, battery charger and 
power state monitors eliminate the need 
for external support circuitry. The pri- 
mary input power disturbance level at 
which the 4020 will no longer respond 
to read or write commands is user set 
with an onboard potentiometer and LED 
indicator. Connection to the card edge 
connector from the IO headers is made 
with wire wrap allowing the 4020 to be 
used with all bus structures including the 
Altair (S-100). The 4020 is priced at 
$287 and may be purchased from 
ElectriCom, 12567 Crenshaw Blvd, 
Hawthorne CA 90250."

New EROM Erasing Lamps 

Two new EROM erasing ultraviolet 
lamps have been introduced by Spec- 
tronics Corp, 956 Brush Hollow Rd, 
Westbury NY 11590. The Spectro- 
line PE-14 is a small ultraviolet lamp de- 
signed especially for the small systems 
users and personal computer enthusiasts. 
The PE-14T is the same as the PE-14, 
but has a 60 minute timer for automatic 
shut off. Both lamps will erase up to six 
programmable read only memory chips 
at one time in 14 minutes. Both UV 
erasing lamps feature a high intensity, 

shortwave UV tube, a specular reflector, 
and a V shaped holding tray that main- 
tains up to six chips at a constant ex- 
posure distance. The high intensity tube 
is fully protected within the anodized 
aluminum housing, and a safety inter- 
lock prevents the unit from operating 
when the tray is not fully inserted. The 
conductive foam pad holds the chip in 
place during exposure and prevents 
electrostatic build up, while protecting 
the chip from possible static charge."

The CSC Proto-Clip integrated circuit 
test clips clip gently onto DIP integrated 
circuit packages and bring their pin con- 
nections to the top end of the clip. 
Cabled versions of this tool include a 
connecting cable preattached to the top 
or business end of the integrated circuit 
test clip. By attaching all leads at the far 
end of the cable to a good working 
ground, each integrated circuit pin is 
effectively shorted to ground and the 
problem of static discharge during han- 
dling is eliminated. The clips are avail- 
able in 14 pin, 16 pin, 24 pin and 40 pin 
configurations; 18, 24 and 36 inch cables 
are available in each clip size. Prices for 
each clip and cable assembly range from 
$7.75 to $21.75 (unit quantities). For 
further information contact Continental 
Specialties Corp, 70 Fulton Ter, New

Micrographics Printer Combines 
Graphics and Alphanumerics 

Pocket-Sized Terminal 

An alternative to the Teletype has 
been developed by Gleichmann & Co, 
Wormser Str 9, D 6710 Frankenthal 

WEST GERMANY. The pocket-sized 
terminal has the same electrical inter- 
face but according to the company 
costs about one tenth as much as the 
conventional solution. 

The size of a pocket calculator, 
the device has a built-in microprocessor, 
works fully electronically, and is noise- 
less. It has a keyboard for 64 alpha- 
numeric characters, produces serial 
ASCII code and is compatible with any 
equipment that operates on a 20 mA 
current loop. It has a 9 digit display. 
The IO lines are galvanically separated 
by optoelectronic couplers. Transmis- 
sion speed is 110 bps or, optionally, 
300 bps. The device measures 3 by 6 by 
1 inches (7.5 by 15.5 by 2.5 cm) and has 
a power consumption of 400 mA from 
the 5 V supply and 140 mA from the 
12 V supply. 

The US distributor is Sedillo Com- 
pany Inc, 225 E Sunnyoaks Av, 
Campbell CA 95008.*

Interface for Teletype Model 40 Printer 

The C/D-40 interface board allows 
the 300 line per minute Teletype Model 
40 printer to connect to a host computer 
or terminal that offers a Centronics or 
Dataproducts interface. Complete hard- 
ware and software transparency is pro- 
vided so that plug to plug compatibility 
exists without making system modifica- 

tions. The C-40 allows for the replace- 
ment of any Centronics printer and the 
D-40 provides for Dataproducts 
replacement. 

The board is self-contained and does 
not require external power when 
mounted within the printer cabinet, 
since power is derived from the printer. 
The board may also be mounted inside 
the host system. This allows for com- 
puter and printer separation, via two 
wire pairs, of up to 2000 feet. 

Standard features include field select- 
able control character code conversion, 
parity selection, extended ASCII, and 
variable motor time out after last char- 
acter received. 

The C-40 is priced at $795 and can

t, 

The Serial Language Independent 
Plotter Controller (SLIP) is installed 
between your terminal and a modem on 
a time shared network or between your 
terminal and a local computer. With the 
connection of an XY recorder to SLIP, 
you have plotting and graphics capa- 
bility. Any teleprocessing site utilizing 
standard RS-232 serial communications 
can become a remote graphics facility. 

SLIP contains a microprocessor to 

provide internal vector and character 
generation features, allowing a maximum 
of plotting with a minimum of data 
exchange. SLIPS capabilities include the 
support of two way user and computer 
communications during a plot, and an 
off line mode which assists in plot 
layout and design. It also detects and 
indicates character format errors. 

During plot generation SLIP inter- 
cepts the plot data from the computer 
and generates XY signals to the plotter. 
The X and Y outputs from SLIP are 
selectable over a wide range of voltages 
to accommodate input requirements of 
most XY recorders. 

The price is $1465 from Special 
Systems Inc, 8045 Newell St, Silver 
Spring MD 20910."

Algorithmics PR-DW1 Precision Printer 

The Algorithmics PR-DW1 Daisy 
Wheel Printer is a printer designed for 
use with microcomputer systems for 
high quality printing and plotting appli- 
cations. This printer operates under con- 
trol of an internal microprocessor and 
communicates with the host microproc- 
essor over a high speed asynchronous 
parallel interface. It prints bidirection- 
ally at rates of 45 characters per second. 
The carriage can be positioned left and 
right in increments as fine as 1/48 of an 
inch (0.53 mm). Hardware options in- 
clude 55 characters per second version, 
metal print wheel, cam feed platen and 
forms tractor. The interface to the host 
computer consists of both hardware and 
software. The hardware component is a 
custom 50 conductor cable that termi- 
nates at the host machine in standard 25 
pin connectors. The software consists of 
two applications packages. One package 
is for text printing and features bidirec- 
tional printing, automatic tabbing, and 
high speed travel over character spaces 
and blank lines. The second package is a 
graphics package that utilizes the 1/120 
inch horizontal and 1/48 inch vertical 
precision print head positioning to 
achieve full graphics capabilities. Price is 
$2678 from Algorithmics Inc, POB 56, 
Newton Upper Falls MA 02164."

TEXT is a word processor which exe- 
cutes on the EPA Micro-68b computer 
with the following equipment: 16 K 
bytes of programmable memory, one 
floppy disk unit, one video display ter- 
minal and a printer. TEXT accepts lines 
of source text interspersed with lines of 
format control information and formats 
the text into a printable, paginated docu- 
ment having user designated style. Some 
of the capabilities of TEXT include: left 
and right justification; automatic word 
hyphenation; page headings; page foot- 
ings, including page numbers; indenting; 
centering; single, double or triple spacing 
of lines; footnotes and bibliography 
references.

Data Base and Query System Responds 
to Pidgin English 

It is said that your home or business 
computer can manage a data base of 
stored information and respond to your 
queries in pidgin English, using a new 
microcomputer software package called 
WHATSIT. The system runs in BASIC 
on a modest personal computer yet it 
brings the power of a data base manager. 
Data is stored and retrieved by typing 
pidgin English requests. Indexing and 
disk space allocation are handled auto- 
matically. The file structure is never 
frozen but develops automatically 
through normal use to adapt to user 
requirements. Stored information is 
automatically cross-indexed under any 
desired headings, and headings may be 
added or changed at any time. Available 
in North Star BASIC, the system runs 
in 24 K of memory. It is offered with 
three ready to run programs on a mini- 
disk for $75. A manual written in non- 
technical language is $25. It is available 
from Information Unlimited, 698 W 70 
S Private Rd, Hebron IN 46341."

Communications Software for 
LSI-11 Announced 

The RT-1 1 compatible software driver 
for the Mighty-Mux 1 1 L, direct memory 
access (DMA) serial line multiplexer, has 
been announced by Educational Data 
Systems, Inc, 1682 Langley Av, Irvine 
CA 92714. 

Providing efficient IO for any RT-1 1 
based LSI-11 system, this new package 
simultaneously supports full duplex 
asynchronous IO to as many as 128 
ports on the multiplexer. Control re- 
quests are provided to determine port 
status, set port characteristics (bps rates, 
parity, etc), assign logical and physical 
port mapping, and abort IO requests. 

For stand alone multiplexing opera- 
tions, modules are provided which may 
be linked directly to an applications 
package. This avoids the intervention 
and overhead of the RT-1 1 IO subsystem. 
A second configuration loads the pack- 
age as a standard RT-1 1 driver. 

The driver will function with any 
V02 system and is provided at no charge 
to users of the Mighty-Mux 1 1 L."

SOFTWARE 

Apple BASIC Instructions. 

Photo I. 

We recently received copies of the 
new Apple II BASIC Programming 
Manual, written by Jef Raskin of Apple 
Computer Inc, 20863 Stevens Creek 
Blvd, Bldg B3-C, Cupertino CA 95014. 
The manual measures about 6 by 8.5 
inches (15 by 22 cm) with 125 pages 
bound within its covers. The book (see 
photo 1) is intended to be a working 
manual for familiarizing its reader with 
the Apple II computer. Whenever 
necessary, internal graphics include 
representations of the machine's key- 
board highlighted with a green color to 
emphasize a point being made. Listings 
of computer output are often printed in 
green, as produced by a matrix printer. 
When a full screen image is represented, 

it is typically printed on the matrix 
printer and reproduced photographically 
as white on black to emphasize the 
image of a television screen. Full color 
reproduction is used for the several 
pages where actual Apple II output to 
a color TV is shown. 

The manual begins with an intro- 
duction on the basics of the hardware 
and its interconnection. There is a 
description of the built-in 5 K integer 
BASIC. The introduction concludes 
with operation of one of the standard 
games supplied on cassette with the 
machine, Breakout. The next chapter is 
entitled Beginning BASIC, which in turn 
is followed by Elementary Programming. 
The formal presentation ends with 
Strings, Arrays and Subroutines as the 
last chapter. Several appendices com- 

Photo 2. 

plete the book. Photo 2 illustrates 
several points about the Apple II BASIC 
Programming Manual. First, note the 
light type and the heavy type in the 
photograph. The lighter printing is green 
in the original, the heavier printing is 
black. Second, there is Jef Raskin's 
inimitable sense of humor which makes 
the manual an enjoyable experience. 
Look at page 24 of the Apple II BASIC 
Programming Manual at a local computer 
store for one of the most elegant modifi- 
cations of a standard typing test string 
ever seen. (The string begins "THE 
QUICK BROWN FOX ... and in its 
original form is known to everyone, 
but in its modified form shows a certain 
humorous familiarity with the urban 
geography of the northeastern United 
States.) 

While not a reference document by 
intent, users of Apples will find much 
information and a verbal delight in the 
form of this BASIC manual by Jef 
Raskin. . .CH»

defined niladic, monadic and dyadic 
functions, 22 primitive functions and 
nine system commands. It can be run 
either in the ASCII or APL character set. 
The range is ±32767 and double byte 
integer arithmetic is used. EMPL comes 
with a user's manual that includes infor- 
mation on implementing it on any sys- 
tem using Z-80 or 8080 processors with 
at least 8 K of memory. EMPL is $10 on 
Tarbell cassette; $20 on paper tape, 
North Star disk, CUTS cassette, or MITS 
cassette from Erik T Mueller, Britton 
House, Roosevelt NJ 08555."

of INTEREST to DESIGNERS 

Easy to Interface Chip Select USART 

System Memory Interface Forms 
2 Chip Microcomputer 

A single integrated circuit for micro- 
processor interfaces which incorporates 
its own memory, internal timing and IO 
ports is now available from Signetics. 
The 2656 system memory interface 
(SMI) can be combined with the Sig- 
netics 2650 processor to form a 2 chip 

microcomputer that provides system 
flexibility and additional memory and 
10 port expansion capabilities. The unit 
is useful for applications where both 
reduced chip count and system flexi- 
bility are necessary. 

The Signetics SMI is a mask pro- 
grammable circuit that offers 2 K by 
8 bit programmable read only memory, 
128 by 8 bit static random access 
memory, eight multipurpose 10 pins 
for external chip selects or 10 data 
port bits, an 8 bit latch for output 
data, and an internal clock generator 
programmed with crystal, RC or external 
input. 

As an aid to system designers Sig- 
netics offers an SM I emulator on a single 
PC card that duplicates all the functional 
capabilities of the 2656 SMI chip. The 
emulator is priced at $250. The SMI 
chip is available in quantities of 1000 
for $17. Contact Signetics, POB 9052,

Optical Comparator for Rapid PC Board 
Inspection 

00mm 

H0E0 

Stuck on any panel by its self-ad- 
hering backing, this microprofile key- 
board avoids the congestion and the 
mounting hardware difficulties of 
mechanical keyboards. Label switches 
produce matrix coded output directly 
and will interface directly with inte- 
grated circuit 74C922 for conversion 
to a binary code. Labels do not bounce 
and so do not require the usual de- 
bounce electronics. Label switches are 
gold plated inside and outside and are 
sealed against the entry of dust or soft 
drinks. Life is estimated at 100 million 
operations. A self-contained flexible 
cable plugs into standard 0.1 inch 
(2.54 mm) spacing- socket. Price is 
$3.95 in single quantities from Compu- 
tronics Engineering, 7235 Hollywood 
Blvd, Hollywood CA 90046.*

An optical comparator for inspection 
of printed circuit boards or other flat 
electrical and mechanical assemblies is 
now available from TM Systems Inc, 
25 Allen St, Bridgeport CT 06604. The 
Model 1013 optical comparator is a 
fully portable, compact device which 
optically compares production circuit 
boards with a master or standard as- 
sembly. Both boards are placed in the 
comparator and alternating images are 
superimposed for viewing by the inspec- 
tor. Any errors are immediately identi- 
fied and located. An image sequence 
rate from 1 to 10 per second can be 
front panel selected and the illumi- 
nation intensity is infinitely variable. 
The comparator features all solid state 
electronics and is designed for operation 
under all lighting conditions at any 
assembly station. Power requirements 
are 1 1 5 V ±1 0%, 50/60 Hz, at 1 A."

This Astro universal synchronous 
asynchronous receiver transmitter 
(USART), the UC 1971 Astro-Chip Se- 
lect, is now available from Western 
Digital, 3128 Red Hill Av, POB 2180, 
Newport Beach CA 92663. This UC 
1971 has many of the features of 
Western Digital's UC 1671 Astro Multi- 
plexed Address: bisynchronous, asyn- 
chronous or isochronous modes, double 
buffered receiver and transmitter data, 
convenient interface to data sets and 
parallel processors. The UC 1971 Astro 
will interface with all popular micro- 
processors on the market. 

The UC 1971, now second sourced, 
features the generalized computer inter- 
face control signals CS, AO, Al, RE and 
WE. Another design and operational plus 
for the UC 1971 Astro is the receiver 
clock and last transmitter bit outputs for 
external CRC generation and checking. 
The operating speed is DC to M bps. For 
further information and price contact

New .6 Inch LEDsfrom IEE 

A line of red .63 inch LED digital 
displays designated as lEE-Hercules 
Series 1800 has been announced by 
Industrial Electronic Engineers Inc, 
7740 Lemona Av, Van Nuys CA 91405. 
Series 1800 includes high brightness, 
dual element models and also single 
element models. The dual element 
LEDs consist of two chips of light 
emitting material which are electrically 
interconnected in series and act func- 
tionally as single segments. Both types 
of red LEDs have wide angle and long 
distance viewing with a high contrast 
ratio. Common anode and common 
cathode versions are available with 
right-hand and left-hand decimal points 
and ±1 overflow. Series 1800 LEDs are 
directly interchangeable with Litronix. 
At the. 500 piece level, prices range 
from $1.65 each for single element to 
$1 .88 each for dual element."

Two "ear" oriented articles were at the 
top of the June 1978 BOMB results. First 
prize of $100 goes to Steve Ciarcia for his 
article "Talk to Me: Add a Voice to Your 
Computer for $35," page 142. The $50 
second prize goes to Bill Georgiou for "Give 
an Ear to Your Computer," page 56. The 
two articles placed 1.6 and 1.3 standard 
deviations above the mean, respectively."

SPACE CAPTURE. It's YOU vs. the PET in an attempt 
to shoot down an alien spaceship roaming the galaxy. Your 
"search and destroy" strategy is pitted against the 
"alien" PET's unlimited patterns of random moves. Like 
a chess game in outer space. Each intergalactic voyage is 
another new, different challenging adventure with infinite 
possibilities. 

HANGMAN. Anyone who was ever a kid has played 
"Hangman". Here's an updated version that programs your 
PET to select words from an expandable list. Try to guess 
the word in 8 guesses before your PET "hangs" you. 
Think it's easy? Don't bet on it! 

PERPETUAL CALENDAR. Never misses a day. Want to 
know when your birthday comes out in the year 3567? Ask 
the PET. Pick any date. Any year. Any century. Bet your 
friends that you can guess what day of the week their 
birthday will fall upon in any year they choose. You (and 
your PET) can't be wrong!

Shugart invented the minifloppy in 1976. 
Today there are more than 100,000 of the little drives 
in use. That's because users want the affordable 
random access data storage of the minifloppy. 

Shugart packs years of proven floppy 
drive technology into this tiny package. Up to 110 
kbytes of data storage. Fast random access of 
about one-half second. And high speed data trans- 
fer of 125 kbits per second. Plus sensible, 
maintenance-free features like write protect to 
prevent accidental data loss, an activity light to 
indicate when the drive is selected by your 
computer and a aoor interlock to protect your 
media from damage. 

Our proprietary read /write head provides 
maximum data interchange margins, and it is 

positioned precisely on the selected track by a 
patented spiral cam actuator. The DC drive motor 
with integral tachometer assures accurate aiskette 
rotation and low heat dissipation. A die cast 
aluminum base plate provides a solid foundation 
for the drive. 

At Shugart, iechnology leadership is more 
than a slogan, it's a commitment. Get reliability 
and value when you invest your money for floppy 
disk storage. Ask for the standard of the industry, 
minifloppy. If it isn't Shugart, it isn't minifloppy.
