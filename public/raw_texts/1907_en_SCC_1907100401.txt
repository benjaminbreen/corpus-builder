(Continued, 

Reverly Calhoun sat on the balcony 
with the princess long after midnight. 
The sky was black with the clouds of 
an approaching storm. The air was 
heavy with foreboding silence, Twice 
from their darkened corner near the 
pillar they saw Baldos as he paced 
steadily past the castle on patrol, with 
Haddan at his side. Dreamily the 
watchers In the cool balcony looked 
down upon the somber park and its 
occasional guardsman, Neither was in 
the mood to talk. As they rose at last 
to go to their rooms something whizzed 
through the air and dropped with a 
slight thud in the center of the balcony. 
The two young women started back In 
alarm. A faint light from Beverly's 
window filtered across the stone door. 

“Don't touch it, Beverly!” cried the 
princess as the girl started forward 

with an eager exclamation. But Ber 
erty had been thinking of the very ob 
ject that now quivered before her in 
the dull light, saucy, aggressive and 
jaunty as it was the night when she 
saw it for the first time, 

A long, slim red feather bobbed to 
and fro as if saluting her with soldierly 
fidelity, Its base was an orange, into 
which it had been stuck by the hand 
that toased it from below, Beverly 
grasped it with more ecstasy than wis 
dom and then rushed to the stone rail- 
ing, Yetive looking on in amazement. 
Diligently she searched the ground be- 
low for the inan who had sent the red 
message, but he was nowhere in sight. 
Then came the sudden realization that 
she was revealing a most unmaldenly 
eagerness, to him as well as to the 
princess, for she did not doubt that he 
was watching from the shadows be 
low, She withdrew from the ral! in 
confusion and fied to her bedchamber, 
followed by her curious companion. 
There were explanations—none of 

“Don't touch tt, Beverly!" 

which struck speaker or Ilstener as log- 
feal—and there were giggles which 
completely simplified the situation, 
Beverly thrust the slim red feather 
into ber hair and struck an attitude 
that would have set Baldos wild with 
joy if he could have seen it, The next 
day, when she appeared in the park, the 
feather stood up defiantly from the 
band of her sailor hat, though woman- 
ly perverseness impelled ber to ignore 
Haldos when he passed ber on bis way 
to mesa, 

The Duke of Mizrox came into the 
city hours after the time set for bis ar- 
rival, It was quite dark when the es- 
cort sent by Colonel Quinnox drew up 
at the castle gates with the visitor, 
‘The duke and his party bad been rob- 
bed by brigands in the broad daylight 
and at a point not more than five miles 
from Edelwelas! And thus the mystery 
of the signal frea was explained, Count 
Marlanx did not soon forget the trium- 
phant look he received from Beverly 
Calhoun when the duke’s misfortunes 
were announced, Shameless as it may 
neem, she rejoiced exceedingly over the 
acts of the robbers, 

Misrox announced to the princess 
and her friends that he was not an 
emissary from the Axphainian govern- 
ment, Instead be was but little less 
than a fugitive from the wrath of 
Volga and the crown adherents, Ear- 
lier in the week he had been summon- 
ed before Volga and informed that his 
absence, for a few months at least, 
from the principality was desirable. 
The privilege was allowed him of se 
lecting the country which he desired to 
visit during that period, and he coolly 
chose Graustark, He was known to 
have friendly feellngs for that state, 
but no objections were raised, This 
friendship also gave Lim a welcome in 
Edelweiss, Mizrox plainly stated bis 
position to Yetive and the prime min- 
ister, He asked for protection, but de- 
clined to reveal any of the plans then 
maturing in bis home country. This 
reluctance to become @ traitor, even 
though he was not in sympathy with 
his sovereign, was respected by the 
princess, He announced his willing: 
ness to take up arms against Daws- 
bergen, but would in no way antago 
nize Axphain from an enemy's camp. 

The duke admitted that the feeling 
tn Axphain’s upper circles was ex- 
tremely bitter toward Graustark, The 
old time war spirit bad not died down, 
Axphain despised her progressive 
neighbor, 

“I may as well inform your highness 
that the regent holds another and a 
deeper grudge against Graustark,” he 
sald in the audience chamber, where 
were asembled many of the nobles of 
the state, late on the night of his ar- 
rival. “She insists that you are har- 
boring and even shielding the pretend- 
er to our throne, Prince Frederic, It 
is known that he is in Graustark, and, 
moreover, it is asserted that he ts i» 
Girect touch wie youw.severnmest.” 

he: 

a. etree anaher’ companions looked at 
one another with glances of compre- 
hension. He spoke in English now for 
the benefit of Beverly Calhoun, an in- 

| terested spectator, who felt her heart 
leap suddenly and swiftly into violent 
insurrection. 

“Nothing could be more ridicalous,” 
said Yetive after a pause, “We do not 
know Frederic, and we are not har- 
boring him.” 

“I am only saying what ts believed 
to be true by Axphain, your highness. 
It Is reported that be joined you in the 
mountains in June and since has held 
a position of trust In your army.” 

“Would you know Prince Frederic if 
you were te see him?” quietly asked 
Lorry. 

“1 have not seen him since he was a 
very small boy and then but for a mo- 
ment—on the day when he and his 
mother were driven through the streeta 
on their way to exile.” 

“We have a new man tn the castle 
guard, and there is a mystery attached 
to him. Would you mind looking at 
him and telling us if he is what Fred 
erie might be in his manhood?’ Lorry 
put the question, and every one pres- 
eat drew a deep breath of interest, 

Mizrox readily consented, and Bal 
dos, intercepted on his rounds, was led 
unsuspecting Into an outer chamber, 
The duke, accompanied by Lorry and 
Baron Dangloss, entered the room, 
They were gone from the assemblage 
but a few minates, returning with 
smiles of uncertainty on their faces, 

“It is impossible, your highness, for 
me to say whether or not it Is Fred 
eric,” sald the duke frankly, “He Is 
what I imagine the pretender might 
be at his age, but It would be sheer 
folly for me to speculate. 
know the man.” 

Beverly squeezed the Countess Dag- 
mar’s arm convulsively. 

“Hurrah! she whispered in great re 
lief. Dagmar looked at ber in aston- 
lahment. She could not fathom the 
whimsical American. 

“They have been keeping an inces 
sant watch over the home of Frederic’s 
cousin, He is to marry her when the 
time is propitious,” volunteered the 
young duke, “She ts the most beau- 
tiful girl im Axphain, and the family 
la one of the wealthiest. Her parents 
bitterly oppose the match, They were 
to have been secretly married some 
months ago, and there Is a rumor to 
the geffect that they did succeed tn 
evebing the vigilance of her people.” 

“You mean that they may be mar- 
ried?” asked Yetive, casting a quick 
glance at Beverly. 

“It is not improbable, your highness, 
He is known to be a daring young fel- 
low, and be bas never failed in a siege 
against the heart of woman, Meport 
has it that he is the most invincible 
Lothario that ever donned love's ar- 
mor.” Beverly was conscious of fur- 
tive glances in her direction, and a 
faint pink stole into her temples, “Our 
fugitive princes are lucky in neither 
love nor war,” went on the duke, “Poor 
Dantan, who ts bid\ag from Gabriel, ts 
betrothed to the daughter of the pres 
ent prime minister of Dawabergen, the 
beautiful Iolanda, I have seen her, 
She is glorious, your highness, 

“I, too, have seen ber,” said Yetive, 
more gravely than she thought. “The 
report of their betrothal ls true, then?” 

“Fils sudden overthrow prevented the 
nuptials which were to have taken 
place in a month bad not Gabriel re 
turned, Her father, the Duke of Mata, 
wisely accepted the inevitable and be- 
came prime minister to Gabriel, Tolan- 
da, it Is said, rematas true to him and 
sends messages to him as he wanders 
through the mountaina,” 

Beverly's mind instantly reverted to 
the confessions of Baldos, He bad ad- 
mitted the sending and receiving of 
messages through Frans, Try as she 
would, she could not drive the thought 
from ber mind that be was Dantan, 
and now came the distressing fear that 
his secret messages were words of 
love from lolanda, The audience laat- 
od until late in the night, but she was 
no occupied with her own thoughts that 
she knew of but little that transpired, 

Of one thing she was sure, Sle could 
not go to sleep that night,

THRILLING SEA STORY. 

Three Survivors of a Crew of Twenty- 
Two. 

A thrilling story of the sea was 
told, when the collier transport J. 
Devonport from 
Gibraltar with three survivors of the 
steamship Andalusia on board, viz., 
Captain McCarthy, Mr. Duncan Mil- 
ler, chief officer, and Francis Camelle, 
a colored seaman, The Andalusia 
foundered in the Bay of Biseay, and 
nineteen of the crew were drowned. 
On the morning of the 13th inst. 
while the J. Duncan was on a voyage 
from Penarth to Gibraltar, the skip- 
} espied several men in a small 

at. The J. Duncan steamed towards 
it, and found Captain MeCarthy, a 
colored man, and the body of anoth- 
ed man in it. Later they discovered 
Miller astride a raft. Captain Me- 
Carthy, in describing the lose of hia 
vessel, said that at 1.90 on the morn- 
ing of the 15th he waa called on deck 
by the chief mate, who reported heavy

Ahe two port boats overboard, and the

forward starboard boat, and T told 
them to unhook the davit tackles and

‘possible to lanneh the boat to wind-

to go with me and clear the atar-

was launched somebody shouted 
“Take to the water!’ When the lash

LONDON IN A FOG. 

An Experience on a Bus on a Suffo- 
cating Black Day. 

I remember once I was on &@ 
Cheapside bus going toward the bank. 
It had been pouring, and little 
streams of water were still runnin 
on the street. The lanterns refle 
Cate on the pavement. Suddenly 
the off horse went down, kicking the 
near one’s feet from under him. In 
their eerugeiee to get up they swung 
the bus’ head around, and we lay 
broadside to the street. I looked to 
see a snarl of wagons, the bus hem- 
med in by jeering cabmen, a gaping 
crowd and the driver jerking at his 
fallen horses. Not so. Six bobbies 
were already on the spot. As if by 
magic a space was cleared about us 
and the traffic checked. Under the 
steady hand of the driver the horses 
were soon up, trembling and mud-be- 
«spattered, but otherwise none the 
worse for their tumble, The police- 
men lowered their hands and Chéap- 
side again resounded with the Lon- 
don roar. 

When a black fog comes down the 
sity vanishes. From your seat on 
the bus beside the driver you cannot 
make out the horses’ heads. The 
‘treet lamps shimmer dimly, sound 
seoma deadened, and when you speak 
vour voice is strange and unfamiliar. 
Your face looks like a chimney 
aweep's, your chest burns as you 
breathe, and near you on the bus you 
hear some people coughing, You won- 
der what they look like. Down on 
the street somewhere there is a thud, 
and some one evrees violent The 
‘river lauehs. ‘This ‘ere’s th’ black- 
vat kind,” he eave, “T guess we're 
fixed ‘ere for a bit. Yer kin just bet 
vour bloomin’ ‘ead T won't budge till 
1 nee th’ ‘orses. Last time T knock- 
«ld down a bloody bobby with th’ pole 
on’ moet ran into th’ Thames.” Every 
little while it seems to lighten, the 
horses take a atep or two, and then 
onee more the world is buried in auf- 
foeating blackness. Your eyes sting 
aa you atrain them throuch the fog. 
All at onee it beeina to lift, and in 
the zenith the avn appears, large and 
strange and red. The buses begin 
to move again. You can gee them 
loomly dimly. crowded with ghostly 
nnasengers, Then aa it grows atill

BANDITS’ CAPTIVE. 

English Youth Ransomed tn Turkey 
For $76,000. 

Once again Turkish bandita have 
extorted their toll from the British 
Government, who have been compell- 
ed to ransom a deaf and dumb young 
Englishman to the tune of $756,000 

1@ Captive, Mr. Robert Abbott, 

1 18, lives with his father, Mr 
Alfred Abbott, in the outskirts of Sal- 
onica, with the open country just half 
an hour's walk beyond Britiah 
Consulate ia on a alight eminence near 
Mr. Abbott's mansion, and there is a 
police-atation within shouting dis 
tance, while General Emilio di Gior- 
gin himeelf, the [hlian offfeer who is 
inapector-general of the so-called “re 
fermed” gendarmerie of the district, 
lives close by 

Robert Abbot was coming home 
from the city by the tramway which 
yannen his father’s gate one night a 
little while ago at 10 o'clock. The 
young man alighted from the tram- 
way cnr, and had just passed inside 
the gate of the carringe-way, bordered 
by high shrubs on one side and trees 
‘on the other, when the hiding brig- 
anda ambushed him and carried him 
off in a carriage 

Tho. brigands had all the advantage, 
because Robert Abbott, though robust, 
is deaf and dumb, His walking-stick 
waa found in the roadway, The brig- 
anda had left behind only a few hand- 
kerchiefs, dropped probably in the 
binding-up process, 

After a time the band of brieands 
demanded ransom, fixed at $129,000, 

which they afterwards reduced to 
$75,000 
Sir Edward Grey communicated 

with Constantinople, but the Turkish 
Government refused to pay, so the 
British Consul-General at BSalonica 
handed over the ransom demanded 
Robert Abbott waa permitted to re- 
turn to his father’s house then, 

Local Superstition, 

A remarkable story is told of a 
farmer who lives near Tifracombe 
who traveled to Exeter to see “The 
White Witch” respecting the death 
of three horses, The animals died in 
a mysterious manner, in the first 
place sitting on their haunches, and 
then lying on their sides, Two veter- 
inary surgeons were unable to say 
what was the nature of the disease, 
and, after the death of the third 
horse, the farmer made the journey 
to Exeter, The woman known as “The 
White Witch” visited the farm, and 
told the man that he had undoubted- 
ly been “witehed,”” The farmer firm- 
ly believes that such was the case 
Tn answer to interrogations by a preae 
man as to whether he really believed 
in the superstition, he replied defi- 
nitely that he was sure that it was 
right, adding, ‘And it waa @ good job 
T went, or else I should have loat 
everything. IT lost all my horses, and 
it was awful.” 

London's Reservoirs, 

London has recently opened two 
new reservoirs, the Messborough and 
the Knight, the construction of which 
was begun in 1901, The Knight, or 
western reservoir, has @ capacity of 
440,000,000 gallons and & water area of 
fifty-one and a half acrea,,and the 
Bessborough, or eastern reservoir, has 
@ capacity of 718,000,000 gallons and a 
water area of seventy-lour acres, With 
the completion of these reservoirs Lon- 
don possesses sixty subsiding and 
storage reservoirs for unfiltered water, 
having a total area of 1,435 acves, with 
a capacity of 8,834,000,000 gallons, 
This storage would be sufficient to 
»rovide a supply equivalent to about 
[erty days of average consumption for 
a Sepelation of 6,750,000 without 
drawing on the Thames or any other 
source of supply.

Nation's Loss Through Drink. 

Sir Thomas Whittaker, M.P., was 
one of the chief speakers at the an- 
nual “At Home” of the Keighley and 
District Chamber of Commerce, held 
in the Temperance Institute, Keigh- 
ley, Eng., recently. Speaking before 
the large gathering of the commercia! 
and trade leaders of the district, he 
cave some striking illustrations of the 
‘arge expenditure of the nation on 
drink. He said: “The £175,000,000 we 
are now spending on intoxicants rep- 
resents an enormous drain on our na 
tional resources, in view of the in- 
creasing keenness of present day “om 
petition. To illustrate: This same 
amount of money would either pay for 
all the flour, bread, milk, butter, 
cheese, and eggs we consume; or it 
would pay all the rates and taxes 
that we levy; or, if we preferred it, 
the amount would suffice to pa 
everybody's rent; or it would fran 
ur all over the rails and trams and 
leave £60,000,000 over. Our people can- 
not afford te throw away their money 
on liquor, No wonder we have over 
crowding, wnderfeeding, sickness, 
poverty and incompetence, lIrivested 
from the age of 20 years the same ex- 
penditure would provide at the age 
of 60 not a pension of 6a a week, but 
one of £2 for life.” 

Deadly Common Plants. 

The things that give the most plens- 
ure in life frequently can aleo cause 
the greatest pain. Among flowers, for 
instance, the beautiful snowdrop, the 
hyacinth, jonquil and narcissus are 
all poisonous, and to eat the smallest 
part of the root of either of them 
would produce fatal resulta, while the 
juices of the leaves will cause violent 
vomiting. The berries of the yew tree 
have killed many people, and the 
MS poe obtained from poppies has ales 
claimed ite victims, Lady's slipper 
and lily of the valley are both danger 
ons, and if the blossomea of crocus are 
chewed they will cause vomiting

Average Wages In Canada. 

The Census and Statistics Bureau 
has issued a blue book as to wage- 
earners in Canada by occupation ac- 
cording to returns of the last decennial 
census, The aver early earnings 
at beg work of all classes of oc. 
cupations is $347.16 for males and 
$181.08 for females, Trade and trans 
portation pays an average wage of 
$503.62 for oe? male employe. Pro- 
fessional men, including clergy, Gov- 
ernment employes, musicians, teach- 
ors, engineers, ete, earn $676.85 per 
yoar on the average, Average earnings 
of males employed in manufacturing, 
$403.14; in agriculture, $207.56 in do- 
meatic and personal service, $272.46, 
Of the whole number of wage-earners, 
814,990, the males constitute 81.76 per 
cent., and the females 18.45 per cent.; 
and, comparing the totals of all wage- 
earners of both sexes by classes with 
the totals of all classes, it is found

Cold in the Chest Seemed to be Unmovabie, 
but Cure was Soon Effeoted by 

Dr. Chase’s Syrup of Linseed and Turpentine 

It is waste of time to use ordinary 
cough mixtures for serious colds on 
the chest, and time is of infinite 
value when the lungs are in danger 

The risk is too great, especially 
when you wait to think that — Dr. 
Chase’s Syrup of Linseed and Tur- 
pentine is for sale in nearly every 
store that keeps medicines at all. 

This letter gives you some idea of 
the effectiveness of this great medi- 
cine: 

Mrs. A. Barnum, Ingersoll, Ont., 
writes: “My husband had a very 
severe cold on his cheat and got so 
bad he could not speak above a whis- 
per. The cough medicines he tried 
seemed to have no effect and reading 
about Dr. Chase's Syrup of Linseed 
and Turpentine [ sent for a bottle. 
In two days he was cured and is 
very grateful for such a medicine. 
He says we will never be without 
this medicine in the house.” 

The very name of Dr. Chase's 
Syrup of Linseed and Turpentine is 
sufficient to explain the simple and 

yet powerful and well-known ingre- 
dients of which this great medicine 
ia composed, 

While linseed sheathes the mouth, 
tongue and throat with a protective 
coating to prevent injury from hard 
coughing, turpentine disinfecta and 
stimulates the ulcerated parts of the 
bronchial tubes and lungs and is al- 
most specific for bronchitia. 

Other ingredients, which along 
with these go to make up Dr, Chase's 
Svrup of Linseed and Turpentine, 
soothe “the nerves, loosen the cough, 
aid expectoration, and by thorough 
action on the whole aystem com- 
pletely cure coughs and colds, bron.

‘Che Closed | 
Gentian 

By Virginia Leila Wentz 
Copyright, 1906, by M. M. Cunningham 

The serious business of settling up 
her brother's estate was about finish- 
ed. Miss Morton leaned wearily back 
in her invalid’s chair and alghed, Aft- 
er all, she was sorry. Doubtless it 
would mean a cessation of her law- 
yer’s frequent and periodic visits. 
And—well, he had been something new 
under her sun. 

“I leave for Bar Harbor tomorrow, 
to be gone a week.. On my return I'll 
send you a telegram and arrange for 
our final interview.” Howell Or 

tured her reverie. He was picking up 
his gloves, A high cart had just driv- 
en under the porte-cochere, and Miss 
Morton's liveried groom was busy 
quieting the antics of a pair of brown 
cobs, 
Miss Morton groped for a pretext to 
spin out the call of her lawyer—if only 
for five minutes, It was stupid of Pe- 
ter to have driven up so early—and so 
bourgeois! Her eye fell on the near 
est object—n bow! of orcsids, 
“Exquisite, are they not?" she sald, 
with a slight indicating motion of her 
patrician, biue veined hand, Orchard’s 
keen glance noted them, at the same 
time ranging the extravagant refine- 
ment of the room, ; 
“In keeping with their surroundings, 
Miss Morton,” he rejoined, pulling on 
his left hand glove, “Artistically cor- 
rect.” 
She made no further pretext. It was 
ous, but it answered her purpose, 
hat is your favorite flower?’ she 
od. 

It was an inane question, and she bit 
her lip, But, to her relieved surprise, 
Orchard gave her inquiry bis consider 
ation. 

“The closed gentian,” he said after a 
slight pause, 

°° oe es e s o ° 

Wynchell, Miss Morton's country 
home, with Its ancestral acres, was 
about far enough from Jersey City te 
leave time on the suburban train for a 
comfortable perusal of the paper and a 
yawn or two besides, 

Orchard spread out his sheet mechan. 
feally, But even the stock market news 
didn't seem to interest him, and he 
looked far beyond bis paper, That was 
only natural. He was looking back 
through several seasons of blossomea 
and snow, this man, who, young as he 
was, had already begun to be called 
@ woman hater, The whizzing tele 
graph wires and poles passed unseen. 

the wheels, dwindled Into allence, In 
their stead came the low, exquisite 
voice of a girl: 

“It's such a beautiful little fower in- 
aide, Howell” — 

The day bad been full of late Bep- 
tember elixir, then as now, The tread 
of loveliness bad been on the felds of 
grass and fodder ripened by August 
suns and tanned by early frosts to an 
autumnal bronze, Bomewhere from 
among the hedges of sumac had come 
the call of a quail. Then presently the 
girl had stopped near a allvery stream 
and plocked a plain enough looking 
dark biue flower and pinned it on his 
coat, 

“Ita a closed gentian, you know, 
dear,” she had explained, while the 
sott tendrils of ber halr had uncon- 
sclously brushed his strong chin. “You 
nee,” she went on, stooping to pluck an- 
other, “they're not so very handsome 
outside, but Inside—look!" Delicately 
as a spring sephyr she had pricked the 
portals open. “It puts the flaming 
goldenrod and all the staring purple 
daisies here to shame, doesn't itt’ She 
lifted her face to him—the face of a 
girl not particularly beautiful, but glo- 
rifled by a dazzling smile, 

He had left her at the gate of her 
little western home and, leaning over 
the rustic fence in the privacy of the 
broad oak, had bid her goodby, for he 
was going to the big eastern metropo- 
lis for a year or two to win fame and 
fortune for them both, He went away 
with the sweetness of her kiss upon his 
lipa, ber tear upon his cheek, her fow- 
er in his coat, 

Later there had come a misunder- 
standing, of the alight, insignificant 
sort that most young lovers have; but, 
alas, in this case before the gentle, 
healing wind of the real truth had 
blown tragedy had visited the girl's 
home, and when the man sought her 
she was not to be found, Out in her 
little western village people told a 
tale of ber father's long Illness and 
death—bow she bad nursed him night 
and day with untiring tenderness; how, 
thelr slight income being exhausted, 
she bad taken up water color work 
and filled orders for dinner cards and 
Uttle pletures; how finally, upon his 
death, she had gone to New York city 
to earn her living in such fashion as 
abe could, 

That was all Orchard had been able 
to learn, and that had been two years 
ago, To find a girl who does water 
color work on dinner cards in New 
York city 1s not an easy matter, By 
the time his train had reached the 
smoke of the tunnel the man with the 
unread paper was thoroughly out of 
concelt with one Emily; by the time 
the ferryboat had bumped Into the 
slip on the New York side he was 
thoroughly out of concelt with bim- 
self, 

. . o o ° . a 

Miss Morton brought her lorgnon ta 
bear upon the flowers Miss Gray had 
fist brovaht in, 

s » “it vou call close 

gentians?’ questioned she half Incred- 
ulously, “Are you sure?” 

“I—I'm very sure, Miss Morton.” 
The girl's volee was exquisitely low 
and musical, 

“But they're so homely, so unfinished 
looking, and I thought—well, never 
mind, Arrange them there in that 
vase, if you will, My lawyer, a young 
fellow in whom I've taken a great in- 
terest, Is coming up to Wynchell to- 
day, and they are bis favorite flower,” 

Miss Gray lost the last of the sen- 
tence. From the silver faucet in Miss 
Morton’s marble bethtub she was 
sawing water for the cut glass she 

hetd. Besides, Miss Morton had spo- 
ken more than half to herself, 

It had been only ‘three days now that 
Miss Gray had been with her in the 
capacity of companion, and already 
Miss Morton found herself exchanging 
that young person’s status from com- 
panion to confidante, She had always 
had a liking for her, this girl with the 
tired, pale face and the sweet, sudden 
smile, ever since the day when she 
had come personally to explain that 
there had been some little mistake in 
the ordered dinner cards and to make 
her apologies, It appears she had giv- 
en the dinner ladies powdered silver 
hair instead of dnzzling gold. That 
had been at the beginning of last sea- 
son. During the present summer the 
little sketches that she had been able 
to sell hadn't proved sufficient for her 
to eke out even a modest existence 
with. Miss Morton was looking for a 
companion, and she had offered her 
services. That is the way it had all 
come about. 

There was the rhythmic thud-thud of 
horses’ hoofs on macadam, and Miss 
Morton's brown cobs whirled through 
an fron gate Into a modest drive and 
came to an abrupt halt under her 
porte-cochere. A gray drizzle had set 
in, but what did that matter to How- 
ard Orchard? The flue drops of rain 
driven against his face by the pace of 
the cobs had been an exhilarating de- 
light to him, and as Miss Morton was 
wheeled into the library to greet him 
he was positively cordial, 

Miss Morton had forgotten her lor- 
gnon, Being very shortsighted, she was 
at a loss to know exactly where her 
companion had placed the gentians. 
And, above all things, should the sight 
of the flowers bring an appreciable 
fraction of pleasure into Orchard’s im- 
mobile face she didn't want to lose the 
sight. She rang for a maid. 

“Ask Miss Gray to fetch me my 
lorgnon,” sald she. 

“So you remembered!” The exclama- 
tion came from Orchard, and Miss Mor- 
ton lost the sight she had wished for, 
after all, He had crossed to an ebony 
cabinet on top of whic stood the cut 
gines vase, “Awkward things to ar- 
range in vases, though,” he commented 
laconically, as If regretting hia burst of 
emotion, 

“Yon, that's what my companion said, 
She went out willingly enough In all 
this drigale to pluck them, but she 
shied at arranging them In a vase, 
She assures me they belong to the 
felds, and” — 

But Orchard veered quickly around, 
In the mirror back of the ebony cabl- 
hot he'd caught the reflection of a girl's 
face. efore he had seen her face, 
though, be had recoguized her, There 
Was ho other woman he knew who 
held her head so proudly and at the 
same time had that wavering little 
walk #0 at variance with the queenly 
carriage of her head, 

“Emily!” he eried, “You! 

The girl's band which beld the lor- 
chon clutched It tightly and went up to 
her breast, The other half groped to 
ward him, as with a little incredulous 
ery she repeated the one word, "You!" 

° ° . . ° ° ° 

“Too bad, too bad,” murmured kind 
hearted Miss Morton Indulgently to 
herself that evening, laying down her 
Goethe unread. The day bad cleared 
beautifully. The last scrap of estate 
settling business had been attended to, 
and now her lawyer and her com- 
panion were enjoying a bit of the mel- 
low moon out on the back 
veranda, “Too bad! I was just begin. 
ning to congratulate myself on what a 
treasure Miss Gray would be in my de 
clining years, and now—the end of the 
beginning or the beginning of the end. 
Marie,” abe sald, turning to the maid, 
“take those homely blue fowerg away, 
Take them up to Miss Gray's room.” 

Fish a Lucky Omen, 

Fish Is a sign of good omen. Ia 
Bengal, when the bride comes with the 
bridegroom for the first time in the 
house of the latter, the former has to 
catch hold of a fish In a certain wel- 
come ceremony, in prospect, perbapa, 
of a generation as fruitful as that of a 
fish, While entering a new house for 
the first time the lady is to take hold 
of a fah, probably for the sams rea- 
son, Whatever may be the reason for 
regarding the handling of fish as auspl- 
clous, it Is indisputable that over a 
large part of northern India the “wa- 
ter vegetable (as it is called by high 
caste Punjabis, who eat it in epite of 
its being considered forbidden food for 
Brahman, Khatria and Banlyas) ts 
taken to assure good luck. The writer 
of this was hastening to Nepal to see 
a sister who was dangerously ill, He 
came across a Nepalese gentleman near 
Patna, who offered to accompany him 
to his destination, being moved to pity 
on hearing of his errand, When cross- 
ing the Ganges from Digha Ghat to 
Paleza Ghat a big bilsa Ash fell at his 
feet on the deck of the steamer as if 
hurled by an unseen hand, Perhaps 
it had been struck by the stern wheel 
and thrown up over the bulwark, The 
Nepalese friend jumped up in great 

excitement, exclaiming: “ilere Is a 
slgn from heaven-—the bapplest omen 
for you, my lad, You will find your 

‘ister out of danger.” All classes in

GIRL CLIMBS STEEPLE, 

In the Teeth of a Terrific Gale Goes 
Up a Church Spire. 

An English girl 17 years old has ac 
complished the extraordinary feat of 
ascending a church spire 260 feet 
in the teeth of a gale o? wind. 

Mr. Larkins, the steeplejack, of Bow 
had undertaken to ascend the spire of 
All Saints’, Hereford, the highest in 
the West of England and Miss Elsie 
Heina, the daughter of one of the 
churchwardens, volunteered to ac- 
company him, 

The ascent was made by means of 
4 seopiareet'e cradle, In spite of the 
loree of wind and of the swaying 
of the cradle, the girl, Mr. ies 
says, was remarkably cool all through 
the perilous ascent and’ descent. Need- 
less to say, the spire had never been 
ascended before by any except male 
climbers, 

A great crowd watched in thrilling 
bus the ascent of the swaying 
cradle. Traffic was entirely blocked b

gained the summit, descended again

ANTIQUE JEWELRY. 

Society Women Revert to Fashions 
of Their Grandmothers, 

A revival of the old fashioned jew- 
elry beloved of our grandmothers is 
worn this winter, 

The chief churacteristic of this jew- 
elry.is its enormous size. Great cameo 
brooches, medallions of Leeds pottery 
set in gold rims and worn as pend- 
ants and massive amethyst, jet or to- 
paz ornaments are being unearthed 
from old jewel cases or hunted for in 
secondhand shops. 

“This fashion is not likely to become 
@ watlversal one,” a well known art 
Gealer said recently, “for the simple 
reason that the supply cannot meet 
the demand. 

“To copy old cameos with any suc- 
cess is an almost impossible task, and 
In any case people object to copies. I 
have a priceless biack Leeds medal- 
lion at present which will be convert- 
ed Into a pendant. Its fortunate wear- 
er cahnot be imitated, as there is not 
buch another piece @n existence. 

“A prettier fashion is the delicate 
Wedgwood jewelry, carried out in its 
typical pastel tints, which tone so well 
with the dresses of today. These also 
tre too rare ever to become common. 

“Old necklaces are also fashionable, 
and many ladies appear this season 
Wearing the old fashioned sets of six- 
ty years ago. These consist of a mass- 
{ve necklace, a brooch and long droop- 
fog earrings.” 

IN EMPIRE STYLE. 

Nightdress For the Girl Who Loves 
Dainty Lingerte. 

A very attractive nightgown of em- 
bire style is illustrated by the accom- 
panying drawing. It le made of Gne 
wconet and consisia of a deep yoke 

immed with diagonal insertions of 
lace set in between clusters of tucks, 
both back and front, and finished a

enough for inch wide wash ribbon td 
be run through. The neck is a little 
bpen in front, being likewise edged 

with beading and a@ lace frill, and the 
pat siceves are finished with lace in 
sertion and full lace edged ruttics, The 
skirt of the gown Is full and gathered 
to the yoke under the wide beading 
which wakes it much more destrabl¢ 
ban having the beading insert be 
tween the yoke and skirt. 
The pattern calle for five and three 
quarter yards of forty inch widt®

The lace insertions run tn diagonel 
es from the shoulders and armboled

The sleeves are shorter than 
those of tho other model and are trim

Making Baby's Mair Curly. 

Young mothers may be glad to know 
that a baby’s balr may often be em 
couraged to curl naturally if it ia 
brushed upward and twisted round 
the foyer while it ie wet. Brushing 
downward rather encourages a child's 
hair te grow straight. The upward 
brushiug is not becoming for the time, 
and tl44 is no doubt the reason that so 
few cure to persevere with the idea; 
bat it well repays one afterward. Of 
course it is not every head of hair 
that responds to the treatment, but ia 
many cases it has been successful, 

Boft soap is a very good thing with 
which to wash the children's hair, but 
remember it froths a great deal and 
very little will suffice, If you use too 
much you will find a difficulty tn rins- 
ing it out thoroughly. 

Vor Cleaning Kid Gloves, 

This recipe may be applied to the 
most delicate tints, and there is no 
odor, It is more desitable than naph- 
tha or gasoline, 

Put the gloves un the hand and then 
take a piece of white flannel and 
moisten it very slightly with sweet 
milk. 

Rub on gently a little piece of castile 
soap and carefully go over the solled 
gloves until clean, Then rub with dry 
flannel cloth, 

FEMININE INFLUENCE; 

Nowhere Is It More Feit and Less Re. 
cognized Than in France. 

There is still in Frenchman 
& great deal of the tal way of 
looking at woman. 

And the French wife knows it, but 
she goes on hel her “man,” be 
she duchess or tte. She will 
forgive again and again; she will let 
him squander her dot, and will learn 
how to do with fewer frocks (the de- 
light of every French woman) in an 
ever pitiful attempt to patch up the 
fortune acd happiness he has wreck- 
ed. If she happen to be a shopman’s 
wife, he needs no bookkeeper or man- 
ager she will be there from morning 

1 night, the slave of the ledger, 
careful of oer centime, while he, 
too, often will leave the heavier part 
of the business in her capable hands 
and turn his attention to a domino 
party at the nearest cafe. If she be 
& peasant’s wife, no one on the farm 
will slave harder than she, There is 
scarcely any labor which she will not 

A London Banquet of 1582, 

A Spanish visitor to London In 1682 
leseribes a banquet of that day, “1 will 
ell you no lye,” be begins cautiously. 
1 saw anch kindes of meate eaten as 
ire wont to be sene and not eaten—as 
| horse rosted, a cat In gely, little liz- 
ifs with whot broth, frogges fried and 
livers other sortes of meates, which I 
wwe theme eate, but I never knew 
what they were till they were eaten.” 
The “quaking custard” of that period 
was a buge dish in the middle of the 
able, into which, “at a private signal, 
he city fool suddenly leaped over the 
veads of the astonished fensters, who 
were instantly bespattered with this 
fich and savory mud.” Undeterred, 
yowever, by this uasty behavior, the 
sitizens not only ate plentifully of the 
sustard, but even took some home to 
thelr wives. Nor were the women of 
those days backward tn demanding ex- 
pensive dainties for themselves, it 
seems, for an essayist of 1001 sarcastic- 
ally asks: “Who will not admire our 
nice dames of London, who must have 
cherries at 20 shillings a pound and 
penscods at 5 shillings a peck? Yoag 
rabbettes of a spanne and chickens of 
an inch?” 

Slaves In Scotland. 

Were there once slaves In Scotland? 
A volume on Scottish Industrial and 
tocial history in the eighteenth and 
alneteenth centuries has some passages 
on the subject: 

“It shocks us very much to learn 
that the men, and even the women, 
who worked In the coal mines at that 
time—t, ¢., the eighteenth centary—in 
Beotland still continued to be, as of 
old, little better than sianves. By a 
law passed by the Scottieh parliament 
in 1606 every man who once went to 
work in a coal mine was bound to la- 
bor In it all bis life as a “necessary 
servant.” If be tried to run away he 
was tried and punished os a thief. If 
the land was sold on which the coal 
pit stood in which he worked he was 
sold with it like any of the machinery 
of the pit, In 1775 an act of pariia- 
ment was passed which sot free most 
of the pit workers, but it was not till 
the end of the century that this form 
of slavery was quite abolished.” 

044 Occurrence In the Hunting Fielé 

On the afternoon of Feb. 8, 1704, the 
hounds of his grace the Duke of Beau- 
fort were in full cry. The run bad been 
a long one, and they kuew that the fox 
wae almost spent. Suddenly the scent 
turned abruptly from the open, leading 
straight toto the garden of a cottage In 
the little village of Castle Coombe. 
Those who were following wondered 
what had happened and were more as- 
toniahed still to see the eatire pack, 
without checking for an lostant, dash 
through the open door lato the little 
room, A sbrill scream was heard, and 
when the whipper in threw himeaelf 
from his horse and gained the threah- 
old he saw a sight which probably no 
fox hunter has ever met before or 
since. A white faced woman stood 
Clasping @ child to ber arms, and right 
there in the cradle, from which the tn. 
fant had just been snatched, eighteen 
couple of derce hounds were struggling 
to devour their fox. 

The Auto Nabit. 

Bome deliver bas found in the Bible 
what he believes to be a bint of auto 
mobiles, It ts contained In the story 
of the vision of Nahum, the Elkoshite, 
concerning the burden of Nineveh. In 
the account given by this seer of the 
military array of the Medes and Baby- 
lonians against Nineveh occurs this 
verse: “The chariots shall rage |n the 
streets, they shall jostle one against 
the other in the broad way, they shall 
seem like torches, they shall run Iike 
the lightning.” If that doewm't de 
scribe a atreet full of motor cars what 
does? Then, again, a variant of the 
word “jostle,” which the original He 
brew will, it Is sald, bear even better, 
is “pass awiftly, without particular 
purpose, to and fro.” Isn't that the 
automobile habit?

Journal gives gome hints to those who

it perfectly \s mot easy, “Time la a 
keynote of successiul pipe smoking,’ 
says the Journal, “and another Is gen- 
tleness, Take it easy, Don't crowd 
the pipe to the top of the bowl, Never 
get a pipe bot, Keep cool, and keep 
your pipe cool, You can relight a pipe, 
and if you are an old smuker you will 
be all the better for it, When you 
have finished do not refill a heated 
pipe.”

Rough on the Unmarried, 

The north Frisians are very unmer- 
elful to people who don't marry. One of 
their legends says that after death old 
maids are doomed to cut stare out of 
the sun when it has sunk below the 
horizon, and the ghosts of the old bach- 
elors must blow them up in the east, 
runaing, like lamplighters, all night up 
and down a ladder. 

WHEEL ROOST, 

Novel Plan for Securing Warmth and 
e “Comfort to’ Hens. 

The coziest and most practical de- 
vice imaginable for furnishing warmth 
and comfort to the hens during win- 
ter nights has recently been suggested. 
After a thorough cleaning of the floor 
in the poultry house a stout hickory 

t about two and one-half inches in 
ter is driven firmly down about 
three feet from the wall. If the house 
is small, 80 only one is needed, put 
ft in a corner. Sharpen the top of 
stake and set thereon a discarded 
wheel. This makes an ideal roost, one 
which will accommodate from twenty- 
five to thirty hens, according to sizo 
of wheel. It is remarkable how such 
& roost delights the hens, The spokes 
are all on a level. The rim and spokes 
make a natural foothold, there is no 
falling off, and the Biddies sit in a 
fluffy bunch, as “comfy” as you 
please. 

But the roost ia only part of the 
plan. If the wheel is placed in a cor- 
ner the two walls will furnish two 
sides of the p “bedroom.” Set 
4 post of 1 by 2-inch strip four feet 
from each of the side walls. Nail 
other strips from the top of this post 
(which should be two feet higher than 
the wheel) to the side walls. From 
these strips hang a curtain made of 
either canvas, muslin, coaree burlap 
or oll carpet, according to conveni- 
ence, which can be rolled or put up 
in the daytime out of the way. Over 
the top make either a board cover. 
ing or one of the curtain materiai 
In this way the hens are comfortable 

A NEW STYLE OF ROOST. 

even in a cold house, In many re- 
specta burlap is the best curtain ma- 
— as it admits air, yet is draft 

proof. 

Tho wheel should not be more than 
30 inches from the floor, The “hop 
a box will prove a convenience. 

wheel is also very enaily cloaned. 
Take it outaide and after placing it 
on a bunch of straw fire it for a brief 
space, or it can be readily sprayed 
first on one side and then on the 
other. 

The advantages of this scheme, as 
described in Towa Homestead, are evi- 
dent. The old way of fastening the 
roosta makes it diMocult to succesa- 
fully fight lice and mites, It ia also 
& great economizer of room. The floor 
space thus saved can be kept clean 
for scratching purposes. 

‘The Nag on the Doorknoh, 

A late home comer, walking through 
the uptown residential section after 
midnight, says the Philadelphia Rec- 
ord, would be surprised to see what ap- 
pears to be white crape hanging from 
hundreds of doors and bell knobs. The 
white thing is not an Indication of a 
child's death, however, but merely a 
bread bag that the baker supplies to 
his customers, For years householders 
had to put up with uncertainty about 
their bread, not knowing whether some 
of the numerous cats that make the 
night less silent had investigated and 
pawed over thelr morning loaf, But 
now the bakers, in order that thelr cus 
tomers might feel more secure, have 
provided these white bags, which the 
housekeeper bangs on the doorknob at 
night and the baker fills early in the 
morning. 

France In China. 

More than elght years have elapsed

tal of the southwestern province, a 
distance of about 280 miles, Labor and 
climatic difficulties as well as a change 
in 1004 of the original trace of the 
line have had much to do with the de- 
lay, but work t# now proceeding all

that the railway will be open as far as

that it has gut saucy and petted, and it wants and insists on havin,

it or not, The Herald fought hart for the University, but failing to get 
it located in its own city it proposes not to sulk and refuse to play 
because it cannot be at bat all the ime, The statement that the Univer.

ates. However, it is $2.00 a head 
to register, and the man without the 
$2,00 is as unimportant a factor in 
educational affairs as the man with- 
out the wedding garment in days 
none by. ! 

ur the more important reason 
why the university graduate is not 
taking the trouble to register is that 
he will have no opportunity to in. 
teceat =himeel! in Alberta university 
matters, An the university is placed 
in one corner of the provirwe the 
southern graduates can never attend 
university council meetings if they 
0 desire, 

As far as the university graduates 
are tohave any say, that word will 
be spoken by the few university men 

in the district of Edmonton and 
Alrathcona, Doubtless for the first 
year or two representatives will be 

brought in from the centre of the pro- 
vince, and from the southern part of 
the province, but when it ts seen that 
these mes do not attend meetings, 
and the men find out how impossible 
it in to attend meetings, the repre 
sentation from any part of the pro: 
vince save that of the t#@o Bdmon- 
tons will be very much restricted, 

So it is not surprising that in this 
day of stringency if many university 
men prefer to feel the warmth of a 
two doller bill in their own pockets, 
rather than the questionable honor of 
sooing their names on a university 
roll, Some may register Toubt- 
jess many wil? for no other reason 
than that there may be some eatin- 
faction in being a member of the first 
convocation of a university, But if 
the university is conducted in the 
future with the same kind of unfair- 
fess apd = treachery to the interests 
of a province as characterized it at 
ite birth, this distinction will be 
nothing very satisfactory for the 
arand-children to boast about, 

However, that is all that there is 
to it, amd that, doubtless, will at. 
tract many to the registration — roll, 
where they will be willing to sac 
rifice a $2.00 bill so that a race un- 
born may rejoice over it and 
how grandfather was a member

One of the matters that should 
command the attention of the Pro- 
vincial Government at the cariiest 
opportunity is the establishment of 
a reformatory for the reclamation of 
juvenile eriminals 
present hour in the custody of the 
police in Edmonton five children un 
der the ages of 13 years, They were 
apprehended for petty thieving from 
tents, and if convicted, what in to be 
done with them’? It will be @ viola- 
tion of all the well established rules 
of sociology if they are sent to a 
prison where they will be forced to 
mingle and mix with adult trans 
gressors and hardened criminals. The 
reformatory for boYs at Mimico is 
one of the most useful of the pub i 
institutions of Old Ontario, Undor 
the careful superintendence of an ex 
perienced and kindly hearted official 
the boys who, either from hereditory 
tendency or through evil communica- 
tions and unfortunate companion: 
ship, have shown criminal tendencies, 
are brought within a newer, brighter 
ami more elevating environmest, and 
are in the majority of cases reclaim- 
ed and put on the highway to useful 
citizenship,

Our esteemed contemporary, the 
Fdmonton Journal in this morning's 
issue, by a singular journaliutic co- 
incidemey, deals with the same sub- 
ject. Our comment was completed

find space to add the following from 
it:

actual menace, and if the subject had

a fow months ago. 

Hight hundred million persons of

miflion square miles of the 
southern and eastern fringe of 
Asia, Of these “three hundred and 
Aity million people on pver wwe Mil

persons of the white race occoupy to 
a greater or lew extent some twenty 
five million square miles in all parte

fourteen million more, This iv ay 
inequality which ambitious yellow 
men are determined to redress, apd 
which the white races, so far as the 
matter has beep impressed ypon their 
consciousness, are determined to 
maintain, To an impartial inhbabi- 
tent of Mare there would seem to be 
no reason why Qaliforpia, Britia

It is evident that the white and 
yellow races can not allow their re- 
lations to drift indefinitely, They 
must reach some sort of common un- 
derstanding, so that all may know 
what can apd what can not be done, 
With such ap understandipy the 
world may be amicably divided be-

Little Miracle 

By Anna Steese Richardson 

| Copyright, 1906, by May McKeon 

It was pretty generally understood 
that the Billy Daltons were drifting 
apart. There was no particular reason 
for this state of affairs, save the lack 
of something better to do. 

You see, they had just enough money 
so that Billy did not have to work nor 
Janet to worry about making both ends 
meet. They had danced thelr way 
through several seasons Into a lazy, 
good humored and comrade-like engage- 
ment, thence into matrimony. After 
that Billy had continued to lead co- 
tillons and Janet to dance them, but 
generally with other partners, 

Matters between them had reached 
the point where the rumor laden socl- 
ety papers bad suggested covertly that 
when Billy went to England and Scot- 
land, where he had nothing In partk- 
ular to do, Janet would probably take 
up her home in Nevada or South Da- 
kota, there to remain until Norman 
Stanley returned from Africa, where 
he was fighting ennul by hunting big 
game, It was even whispered that 
Billy Dalton had insinuated to Stanley 
that It was rather better taste to stalk 
big game than another man's wife, es- 
pecially when the other man was per- 
fectly willing to make it clear sailing 
for his wife if it would make her any 
happier. 

Of course, this sounds a bit strong on 
paper, particularly to the old fashioned 
folk who still believe that marriage ts 
a contract for life and not a mere epl- 
sode, In the set to which the Billy Dal- 
tons belonged the situation was ac- 
cepted as a matter of course, and when 
Janet asked a lot of people down to 
their Long Island place for the auto 
mobile races and the week end no one 
thought of refusing just because the 
Daltons might separate within a fort 
night after the gathering. 

Buch was the situation when the 
Dalton car broke down on the Jericho 
turnpike, and its occupants—Janet, 
Mra. Greenwalt, Joe Jeffreys and 
“Marsh” Huntoon—decided to cut 
through the woods to the Dalton place 
and leave the car for a farmer to guard 
until the mechanic who handled the 
Dalton garage could be dispatched to 
the scene of the accident, 

Perhaps it was not entirely Impa- 
tience which led them to take the 
short cut through the woods, but the 
call of a hundred autumn voices tn 
rustling leaves, rich, warm colorings 
and the chatter of squirrels laying up 
winter stores, And thus it was that 
they suddenly stopped In thelr tracks 
and listened to a sound that was not 
of the woods, but of the nursery—the 
plaintive wall of a child, Janet it was 
who found It—a bit of white faced, 
staring eyed humanity rolled up snug: 
ly In a great shawl of Iceland wool, 

While abe held the baby in her arma 
and tried to silence ite walle with un- 
certain and awkward little pettings the 
quartet held a conference, The child 
Was too young to bave walked there, 
Mra, Greenwalt sald it was not a day 
over two months old, It was too far 
from the road to be heard by passing 
travelers, Ab-—there was the answer, 
a wiep of paper tled to the end of the 
shaw! 

“Please take care of little Elste, It 
was not her fault that she came into 
the world, and T ean do no more,” 

“T've always sald that the govern- 
ment ought to regulate the question of 
marriage among the poor,” remarked 
Mra, Greenwalt severely, “Here ls a 
case In point,” 

“You are Jumping at conclustona,” 
sald Huntoon dryly, “Let's take it to 
the town marshal" 

“And what then?" asked Janet with- 
out lifting her gaze from the child's 
face, The baby had clutched her fin- 
ger with ite tiny Ost and settled down 
an if it had found anchorage, 

“Oh, there are asylums and homes 
for youngsters like this, You'd better 
hurry along home with It before It be- 
gine to bowl, One of your men can 
take It to town before dark, Shall I 
carry the little beggar for your’ 

“Oh, no, She's not a bit heavy, and 
she Is quiet now, She might cry if we 
changed her position.” 

They trudged on through rustling 
leaves and soft Indien summer haze, 
three of the party chatting gayly; two, 
the young wife and the baby, looking 
into each other's eyes as if searching 
for a new key to the problem of life. 
Sometimes Janet wished that the child 
would close its eyes, She did not Ike 
to meet that trustful, clear eyed gaze, 

* . > * * * . 

“Have you disposed of the young: 
ster?’ asked “Marah” Huntoon as they 
sat down to dinner that night, 

Janet started and looked across the 
table at her husband, He lifted his 
eyebrows tnquiringly. 

Hluntoon's good humored laugh broke 
the awkward allence, 

“What? Don't you know that our 
party was increased by one during our 
ride this afternoon? Rather a small 
‘one,’ but, my, what lungs it has!” 

Janet drew in ber breath sharply. 

“I wish you would not talk any more 
about It at present, good people,” she 
said, trying to speak lightly, “I've 
started Inquiries In a quiet way, I 
don't want the thing to get into the 
papers—because if no one claims Uttle 
Bisie I think II shall keep her.” 

“Keep her! gasped Mrs, Greenwalt. 
“Why, my dear girl, the place for a 
child without a name ts a foundiing 
asylum,” 

Janet spoke very softly, yet every 
word was heard, so complete was the 
ailence, 

Ing an tiffeceisdry’ Meuttorahee at 
the crucial moment? 

Within the Dalton bungalow on Long 
Island stranger things were bappen- 
Ing. No clew to the baby's parents 
had been found. When Billy Dalton 
dropped down occasionally, as he had 
been doing for a year past to keep up 
appearances, his first question was, 
“Anything new?" and this always 
meant “anything new about the baby's 
history.” And little Elsie would look 
up at him with reproachful blue eyes 
as if asking, “Why do you care?” And 
the worst of It was that Billy Dalton 
began to realize that he didecare. Janet 
had changed, and, with an odd sort 
of jealousy, he realizetl that it was lit- 
tle Elsie and not he who had brought 
about the marvelous and altogether de- 
sirable change. She was no longer 
bored. How could she be with Bisie 
cutting a new tooth every few days 
and such wonderful hampers of clothes 
to be bought, fine handkerchief linen, 
narrow val and convent embroidery? 
A more fastidious customer had never 
entered the shops which specialize on 
layettes, and with her own hands Janet 
made covers for down pillows, silk 
tufted afghans and other foolish things, 
while the tongue of gossip wagged 
gayly over the whole absurd episode. 

One frosty December afternoon Dal- 
ton ran down to the bungalow and 
found Janet standing at the window. 
The low spreading evergreens on the 
west aide of the house were powdered 
lightly with snow, and Janet turned to 
him with kindling eyes. 

“Billy, I shall have a Christmas tree 
for Elsie, She is so bright for her age, 
I do belleve she will notice it.” 

“Quite likely,” responded Billy, with 
Assumed carelessness, as she laid aside 
his storm coat, “but in making your 
plans you seem to have oyerlooked one 
Important fact. As yet Blaie is not 
really yours. The law’— 

Janet turned on bim sharply. 

“She is mine by right of—everything. 
I found her, and 1 love her.” 

“Yes, but you must formally adopt 
her, I thought perhaps you'd better 
see to that before I leave, I've changed 
my plans a bit. I'm going to meet 
mether and Grace In Rome for Chriat- 
mas, The mater has not been feeling 
very ft. I am not fond of England in 
winter, and” — 

Janet crossed to his side, and her 
hand rested lightly on bis arm. 

“Don't you think you'd enjoy much 
more seeing Elete have her first tree? 
And—and | think—I need you—more 
than your mother does,” 

Something rose in Dalton’s throat 
and threatened to choke him. It was a 
sensation he had never felt before, not 
even during the good natured, lazy run 
of his woolng. Janet wanted him! He 
thought be had not cared. Now he 
knew that be had cared all along. But 
it was charactertatic he did not express 
his ferce joy In words. He held Janet 
very close and whispered: 

“Well, I rather did hope you'd give 
the little beggar the name of Dalton, 
It's a pretty good name after all, eh?’

he landed In London, He sent a lion's

Not Teo Abrupt, 

Radical changes in clothing are sel 
dom safe, at least #o the old time 
grandmothers held, The putting off of 
winter underwear was likely to be a 
gradual and prolonged process, That 
this bellef in deliberate adjustment 
was widespread and loclusive is shown 
in W. P. Prith’s story of bis life, He 
was engaged in painting a portrait of 
Mra. Birt, the wife of a prominent 
business man, who used to bring her 
little dog to share her sittings. 

Mr, Birt was a great lover of dogs, 
but he entertained a strong aversion to 
dog collars, so | was surprised one day 
when Mra, Birt brought her favorite 
dog, Ducky, to see a band around the 
little animal's neck, 

“I thought you objected to dog col- 
lara, Mra, Birt," 1 sald. “I see Ducky 
sports one today,” 

“Oh, no, that's not a dog collar,” re 
turned the lady. “It's only a plece of 
flannel, The poor dear has had a 
dreadful cold and a sore throat. She 
has worn flanne! night and day,” 

“Surely that Is too narrow to do any 
good, The strip is no wider than a 
collar,” 

“Oh, 1t was wider, of course. We 
have gradually lessened it. She Is 
leaving it off by degrees,” 

Nothing bat the Truth, 

Buacum—My physician tells me I am 
working too hard, 

Marka—The M. D, evidently knows 
his business, 

Buncum—Why do you think #0? 

Marks—I have been comparing notes 
with a few of our mutual friends and 
I find you have worked us pretty hard

Stole te Get Medion! Ald, 

A poor man in Vienna found It Im- 
possible to galn admission to any of 
the public hospitals because they were 
all overcrowded, Ile stole a pair of 
shoes to get himself arrested, reason- 
ing that in the jail he would receive 
medical treatment. He was given the 
necessary medical attention and when 
he recovered his health served a brief 
term for petty larceny, 

Leaves as Food, / 

In England beech, willow jand goose- 
berry leaves have been w for sal- 
ads, and not #o very longjago, when 

| famine invaded northern \Italy, the 

peasants kept themselves’ alive on 
boiled chestnut leaves, not ithe nuts, 
which are thelr tmportant crop. 

One Mistake Enough. | 
Among those who handle high explo- 
sives there runs this proverb; “In, this 

“{ shall give her @ name because— | business a man never makes more 

once-—Just once-—I saw a Iine of chil 
dren walking, rows and rows, by twos, 
from an orphan asylum, I can't send 
her there,” 

Mentally she saw again those clear, 
trusting blue eyes, 

“And I know you will all be kind 
enough to keep this very quiet until" 
there was just a slight, tense hesita- 
tion—“untll we decide what shall be 
done,” 

Naturally it was talked about, how- 
ever, In boudoirs and at clubs the 

question was raised as to what name , 

little Elsie would acquire, Was it not 
bad enough to be facing a divorce real- 
dence in ie for weat without acanis-

Impure Part of Ice. 
The center of a cake of artificial ice 
is generally opaque, while the part first 

| frozen, the outside, is generally clear, 

As water freezes slowly, all the im- 
purities are pushed away from'the part 
first freezing. The central opaque part 
contains all the Impurities, even the 
bacteria which may be in the \water,

The Kindness of the Poor, 
The old adage that the poor are the

upport, After a lingering sickness the 
‘ounger of the children died, and, the 
‘oung mother’s bank account having 
een depleted from defraying the ex- 
wnses of the weeks of medicine and

What Words Can Do. 

“Any one who swears,” declared the 
‘shop of Carlisle, “manifests the beg- 
farliness of his vocabulary.” The Con- 
tord Patriot puts it In this fashion: 

“People swear because they do pot 
tnow the possibilities of plain Eng. 
ish or have not the skill to manipulate 
t so that it will yleld the amount of 
fre they want. You can do almost 
inything with common words, No 
matter how tame and Iifeless they 
ook standing tn stupid rows ao» if 
they didn't know enough to come in 
when it rained, they can be made to 
lance like imps, to frolic like fairies, 
to float angelwise on light wings, to 
tlow like fire spirits. They can do 
things that make the ordinary bits of 
yrofanity look like feeble scarecrows 
itiffened up with a fence stake, The 
vure for profanity—reformers and edu- 
mtors please make a note—is merely 
wit enough to handle your words so 
that swearing will seem like baby talk 
nh comparison.” -_ 

When Blondin Was Afraid. 

One of Blondin'’s favorite jokes was 
to offer to carry some distinguished 
spectator across the rope with bint ou 
his back. Everybody naturally refuse 
ed, and the great equilibrist, with a 
genial amile, would say, “I am sorry 
you are afraid I should drop you.” 
But he was holet once with his own 
petard, 

He was exhibiting la Paris and was 
about to cross the Belne on bis rope. 
Cham, the great cartcaturist, had come 
to make asketch, Blondin, recognizing 
him, at once Invited him to cross with 
him. 

“With pleasure,” replied Cham, “but 
on one condition.” 

“And that Is"— queried Blondin, 

“That I shall carry you on my back,” 
answered Cham, 

“Not if I know myself,” answered 
Blondin. 

“Ab,” triumphantly exclaimed Cham, 
“this time, M, Blondin, it ls you who 
are afraid!"

THE CHRONICLE, STRATHCONA, ALBERTA. 

A FAMOUS VIKING. 

Late Captain Jackman of Newfound 
land Captured In His Time 
662,610 Soals. 

In the death, recently, of Captain 
Arthur Jackman, Newfoundland lest 
ta most famous Viking. 

For over forty Ags this mariner 
aavigated a ship the ice-fields off 
the coast of Newfoundland in quest of 
vals, Some of adventures 
which he was the hero are amongst 
the saad thrilling incidents in m 
inn 

His name is a household word all 
over the island colony for his skill and 
jaring as @ mariner, and as probably 
the greatest and most successful cap- 
tain who ever steered a ship through 
she frozen ocean in search of seals, 

His knowledge of the coast of New- 
‘foundland evoked universal admira- 
tion. He was able to find his wa 
shrough the most dense fogs and furi- 

‘8 tempeste with anaszii certainty; 
‘is record on the coastal service being 
arked by senrealy on wecident. This 
year, for the first time in over forty 
the famous old mariner will be mise- 
ing at the ico, He has gone on his 
ast voyage; the ocean-—eternity; the 
oilo eath, 
His Sealing Career. 

Captain Jackman was born in 1843 
at Renews, where the first of the 
Jackman family settled on coming to 
Newfoundland from Devonshire, near- 
Rf two centuries ago. Animated by 
the spirit of daring and adventure 
characteristic of the race, he took to 
the sea as a pursuit, and sailed as a 
tad with his elder brother, the late 
Capt. Wm. Jackman. Ip 1865, at the 
age of 23, he was given cormmand of a 
schooner at the seal-fishery, continu- 
ing to oh Sage that industry until 
1871, when he made his last voyage 
in a eailer, the Fanny Bloomer. 

Appointed Master. 

Then he was appointed master of 
the Hawk, in succession to his bro- 
ther, who had been promoted to the 
command of the first steamer Eagle 
which had then been brought out a 
new ship from Scotland. During the 
ensuing 36 years he has had com- 
mand of the following sealing steam- 
era: Hawk (six springs). Falson (four 
springs), Norwhal (one spring), Reso- 
lute ( springs), Eagle, lost (seven 
springs), Aurora (four springs), Terra 

ova (six spfings), the present Eagle 
‘three springs). 

During these 36 gare he has brought 
into St. John’s, Nfld., 652,510 seals 
or an average of 15,547 per year, the 
aggregate value being estimated to 
exceed $1,000,000, 

During this period more than 8,000 
men have been under his command, 
and he has the record of never having 
loat one. In the worst blizzards that 
desolated the floes hé always contriv- 
ed to pick up his crews, Some years 
however, deaths have occurred to 
some of his men through colds, or 
other diseases, but in 1897, the storm- 
leat spring in sealing annals, four of 
them di of diphtheria. That was 
the year he killed his trip off the Vir- 
gin Rocks, and waa the only one of 
the fleet to load. He did the same 
again in 1905, and at was the sen- 
sation caused by his unexpected ap- 
pearance after getting a trip away off 

he Banks 
Arrived First. 

On March 21, 1878, he arrived first 
in the Falcon with 21,190; on March 
Si, 1885, in the Resolute with 34,628; 
on March 27, 1806, in the Aurora 
with 29,916, and on March 24, 1905, 
in the Eagle with 92,0064. He also en- 
joyed the reputation bringing in a 
saving trip every year, During his 
career two ships were lost under him, 
the Hawk in 1876, and the Resolute 
in 1886, but the crews were saved 
each time. In 1886, when Bowring 
Bros. took the first coastal contract, 
with the Curlew and Plover, Capt. 
Jackman was appointed to the com- 
mand of the former ship on the west 
route and continued on that service 
for years. In 1889 he and his crew in 
the Plover narrowly escaped death 
while on a voyage from Syd ey to St 
John's with a © of coal, and their 
rescue was one of the most thrilling 
incidents in marine annals, 

His Arctic Record, 

Besides his sealing voyages, Capt. 
Jackman was the pioneer of the New- 
foundland venture in the Greenland 
whaling industry, and went to the 
Arctic seas several years, Command- 
er Peary, the famous Arctic explorer, 
made his first trip there with Capt. 
Jackman in 1886, In 1893, while on a 
whaling voyage, the Eagle was lost, 
and the story of how Captain Jack- 
man brought his crew safely in open 
boats through hundreds of miles of 
loe-strewn seas, is equal to any in 
Arctic annals, and ts one of the most 
stirring in marine history. 

When the “Discovery” South Polar 
expedition was frozen fast in Antare- 
tic waters, and the Admiralty bought 
the sealer “Terra Nova” for a relief 
expedition, Commodore Montgomerie, 
of H. M. 8. Charybdis, who was en- 
trusted with getting a a} and a 
commander, chose Captain Jackman, 

In 1900 he went in the Kite to the 
relief of the American whaling station 
in Cumberland Sound, Baffin Land, 
after a sailing vessel bound there from 
Boston had been wrecked_on Northern 
Labrador; and though it was very late 
in the season when he received or- 
ders to start, he carried out his mis- 
sion with conspicuous success, His 
last great feat was the towing to St, 
foun s, in the trawler Magnific short 
y before Christmas, 1904, of the 
schooner Bessie Dodd, cast away on 
Labrador, Dr. Grenfell lavished un- 
tinted praise upon him for his splen- 
did work on that occasion, 4 

Work of Canadian Artists, 

An interesting sign of the times is 
the predominance of Canadian scenes 
and sketches in the work of Canadian 
artists, There was a time when our 
artista received al) their inspiration 
from Europe; they were taught in 
European schools, and painted Euro 
pean landscapes, or, if by chance they 
sketched a Canadian seene, it was 
fron! the point of view of an Old 
Country man, But now all that is 
changed. During the last few years 
there has arisen a generation of men 
who paint Canada as it appears to 
them. Northern Ontario bas been o 
very special source ef inspiration te 
these mean. “ty 

Oldest Thing In the World, 

Mexican botanists believe they have 
discovered the oldest thing in the 
world In a cypress of Chapultepec, the 
trunk of which Is 118 feet in eclftum-

lated as 6,200 years, 

Snukesn, 

Of all the creatures to be seen at 
soological gardens snakes are probabiy 
the most easy to ship from one coun- 
try to another, Snakes take very little 
room and throughout a long voyage 
give not the least trouble, They do not 

‘require to be fed nor do they require 
looking after in any other way, .

Sponge Farms, 

Several sponge farms, all of which 
are paying coucerns, are to be found 
In the Mediterranean. Until recently 
sponges have been simply collected 
from the sea floor, where they have 
flourished in a wild state, but of late 
years they have, like oysters, been cul- 
tivated,

How He Got Even. 

During civil war times Gilman Fay, 
a local character known by all as 
Gil, being In need of groceries and 
household necessities, went to the gen- 
eral store in Fayville, kept at that 
time by Colonel Dexter Fay, to make 
his purchases. The amount was 68 
cents, and Mr. Fay tendered the clerk 
a one dollar bill. Change being scarce 
in the store, as was often the case dur- 
ing these strenuous times, the clerk 
passed him some slips of paper with 
figures on them to equal the amount of 
change due. Gil looked at the slip, 
then at the clerk, and slowly said, 
“What's all this?’ “Why, that is what 
we are giving for change now. When 
you get one dollar's worth, we will re- 
deem them,” replied the clerk, and 
Gil went out. A day or two after 
this occurrence Gil went to the 
store again for some tobacco. The 
clerk passed out the plug, and Gil 
put his hand In bis pocket, pulled out 
a handful of pumpkin seeds and band- 
ed them to the clerk, saying: “These 
are what I am using for change now. 
When you get a dollar's worth, 1 will 
redeem them.”—Boston Herald, 

A Bluff With a Cork Leg. 

“Cork legs are not bad in their way,” 
said the man who had one. “Some 
people are rather sensitive about theirs, 
but I’m not. I even have a little fun 
with It sometimes. I wag In the amok- 
er of a railroad train the other day 
talking with three other men while we 
puffed away at our cigars when the 
conversation turned on stoleism. Ev- 
ery man bad an Incident to relato 
about some acquaintance’s remarkable 
ability to bear extreme pain without

finished his yarn I mentioned casually

ity to put up with a good deal of pain 
without making a squeal, ‘To Iilue 
trate, I sald, and then opened my pen- 
knife and slowly forced the point of

other became deathly pale, and tho 
third got up and hastily left the car.”—

Stories of Brahms. 

Many stories are told of bow the com 
poser Brahms treated pianists and 
singers who were eager to get his crit! 
clam, If one of these aspirants for bis 
favor was fortunate enough to find him 
at home and be received, Brahma’ first 
concern was to seat himself on the lid 
of his plano, a position from which he 
rightly deemed few would have the te- 
Mmerity to oust him. If this failed, be 
had recour# to the statement that the 
instrument was out of tune, “Ob, that 
does not matter,” remarked one cour. 
ageous individual, “Perhaps not to you, 
but it does to me,” replied the master, 
On one occasion be was Just leaving 
bis bouse when a long hatred youth, 
with a bundle of music under his arm, 
hailed him with, "Can you tell me 
where Dr, Brahina lives?” “Certainly,” 
answered the master in the most amla- 
ble manner, “in this house, up three 
flights.” And, so saying, be burried 
away, 

The Treacherous Lioness, 

“Lionesses are far more dangerous 
than lions,” sald an animal trainer, 
“Thelr tempers are more uneertaln, 
They are more treacherous, They are 
more wily, If a tion is In a bad hu. 
mor, be shows it. He growls and 
snarls and lashes bis sides, You know 
what ts in the wind and prepare ac- 
cordingly. But a loness in a bad hu- 
mor Is as affectionste as a girl, She 
brushes, purring, against your leg, and 
she minds you with the joyous alac 
rity of a good fox terrier. Then, as 
s00n as your back Is turned, whiz—a 
yellow streak shoots through the air, 
and you are on your back, and she Is 
at your throat, With all the cat tribe 
it is the same, Whenever you hear of 
@ trainer mauled or mangled, be sure 
it was a female, not a male, cat that 
did the deed.” 

Greenland’e Glaciers, 

Nearly all the Greenland glaciers and 
tongues from the Internal ice cap ter- 
minate in vertical faces from 100 to 
1,000 feet high, presenting facilities for 
investigation, The vertical faces reveal 
pronounced stratification on the basal 
ice, even earth materials in the bases 
carried by the ice belng arranged in 
layers, Fine laminations were seen 
twelve or twenty to an inch, The lay- 
ers are sometimes twisted and con- 
torted and even “shoved” over each 
other, The glacier movement at the 

| !ce border is a foot per day to a foot 

per week, 

Force of Example. 

“Talk about the instinct of the lower 
orders! I built a little two story house 
for our parrot not long ago, and the 
very next morning after I put her in it 
she looked out of the window and 
greeted me in a very profane fashion.” 

“Why should she do that?” 

“Complaining about the house, 1 
fancy.” 

“But why should she swear at you?’ 

“Took me for the janitor, no doubt.”

Dehorning a Rhinoceros. 

A thinoceros which lived In the Lon 
fon zoo was troubled by its horn, 
which grew down in front of its mouth, 
to that only with difficulty could it‘eat 
w drink. To save its life the keeper 
lecided on amputation, The horn of a 
| *hinoceros is not a born at all, but an 
tecumulation of hair and skin which 
tas hardened and become cemented to- 
fether by some guiomy substance. The 
ywher of this one had a very touchy 
temper and was not easily approached, 
(ts keeper, however, decided to try 
What he could do. For some days It re- 
quired all bis skill to persuade the 
| beast to come to the front of the cage 
tnd put Its horn through. Then for 
tome days he stroked the horn, much to 
the animal's disgust at first, although 
later it seemed to like it. When it 
found he meant no harm it let him take 
the horn in bia left hand and then with 
the right imitate the motion of a saw 
| \cross it. When this had been done 
tome time and the rhinoceros no longer 
hinded it, a plece of wood was held In 
the right hand, and at last, when even 
this no longer worrted the animal, a 
teal saw was brought in and the horn 
|tut off without the slightest remon- 
| ttrance from the owner of It. 

Outcome Always Same. 

A Philadeiphian was praising for his 
learning and uprightness the late 
Judge M, Russell Thayer. He quoted 
the moving passage from Judga Thay- 
t's will, “Owing to the fact that al- 
most my entire life has been passed in 
the public service of the United States 
and of the stage of Pennsylvania, I 
bave but a small estate to leave to my 
fear children and wife.” 

“Judge Thayer,” he continued, “was 
8 very honorable man, First as a law- 
yer, afterward as a judge, he treated 
tll with whom he had dealings with 
the greatest fairness. Once, years ago, 
tfter be had served me well in a dif- 
Gcult case, I remonstrated with bim 
tbout the smallness of his fee.

A Terrible Punishment. 

A man suspected of treason in Mo 
tocco was punished by having the 
flesh of his hand sited, the wound 
|Diled with salt and the whole band 
jtewed up in leather, It ts a common 
belief that this punishment causes 
mortification to set tn and that the 
hand decomposes, but such ts not the 
tase, for by the time the leather wears 
off the hand ts healed, the result being 
that the band ts rendered useless and 
remains closed forever. It ls a punish- 
ment not often In use, but is some- 
times done In cases of murder or con- 
ttant theft, as, without in any way in- 
juring the bealth of the man, It pre 
rents his committing the crime a sec. 
ond time or for the bundredth time, 
fe the case may be. It Is a punteh- 
ment that cannot be applied except by 
the sultan'’s orders.—Blackwood's Mag- 
azine, 

A Fairly Big Fish. 

Paddy had been telling the story of a 
big pike be caught, too big to get into 
the boat, so that he had to be towed 
behind (with the gaff in It, it must be 
understood), Then followed this dia- 
logue: “What weight, Paddy? “Div- 
vil a know I know, but he was an ojous 
baste.” “Was that the biggest you 
ever saw, Paddy?’ Then Paddy gave 
a description of the biggest he ever 
saw, “What weight, Paddy?’ “Sorra 
a bit I know. He was a terror,” 
“Flow big, Paddy?” “Sure, I can’t tell 
to a foot or two, but a man could walk 
down his throat.” On this Incredulity, 
but Paddy “clinched the matter and 
silenced all controversy” by adding, 
“Wid his hat on.”--Angler’s Evenings 

Emergency Foode. 

According to Dr. Robert Hutchinson 
of London, if at any time meat Is not 
available, bread, sugar and eggs will 
make “a very respectable support for 
the body.” Sugar ts an exceedingly 
valuable article of food as a source of 
energy, the unfortunate thing about It 
being that it contains no nltrogenous 
matter, Bread, however, does contain 
tome; hence it balances up well when 
combined with sugar, In times of 
scarcity of food bread and molasses is 
not a half bad diet—at least It can be 
relied on to keep the body up to a fair 
state of efficiency, 

Women as Walkers. 

Even the athletic girls and women 
of today can hardly make any ad- 
Vance upon the record of Mary Lamb, 
who wrote to Miss Wordsworth (both 
women being between fifty and sixty 
years old): “You say you can walk 
Oifteen miles with ease, That Is ex- 
actly my stint.” She then speaks pity- 
ingly of a delicate woman who could 
accomplish “only four or five miles ev- 
ery third or fourth day, keeping very 
quiet between.”

Andrew Jackson's Education. 

During each winter for two or three 
years after he had reached the age of 
seven Andrew Jackson was sent to the 
old field school of a Mr, Branch, After 
this he attended the select school which 
a Presbyterian preacher, the Rev. Dr. 
David Humphreys, taught in the Wax- 
haw settlement, He appears to have 
been going to this higher school in the 
spring of 1780, when the inrond of Tar- 
leton created a panic in that portion of 
the Carolinas, At some later period of 
his youth he is said to have attended 
the old Queen college or seminary at 
Charlotte a couple of terms, but the 
time {s not definitely known. 

As to education, therefore, it may be 
safely stated that Andrew Jackson en- 
Joyed much more than the ordinary ad- 
vantage of a backwoods boys of his 
time. At the age of ten he had become 
0 good a reader that he was often 
chosen to read the newspaper to the 
assembled neighbors, and he remem- 
bered with pride in after years that he 
had thus had the honor of “reading out 
loud” the Decihration of Independenct 
tpon Its arrival in the Waxhaws. For 
a lad of ten this was, indeed, some 
thing to remember with honest pride

tonian Magazine. 

Caustic. 

Recently a wearled looking little 
mother, carrying a small baby, boarded 
f street car and took a sent next to 
two men who were earnestly engaged 
in conversation. Neither of the met 
was very handsome, and it must have 
required considerable nerve on their 
part to hand out their photographs 
among their friends unless the pictures 
had been previously retouched with 
sandpaper. In a few minutes the baby 
began to cry with a reliable yelp that 
could be heard above the din of the 
street babble for half a block, and, 
with a grouchy glance at the young- 
ster, one of the men arose and peevish- 
ly remarked to bis pal: ‘ 

“I think we had better sit over here, 
Jim.” 

This wungallant act plainly embar-

A Dying Glass. 

In the glass collection at the Museum 
of Art In Dresden, Germany, there ts a 
large drinking cup which stands apart 
from all other art objects under a 
heavy glass cover. It Is of Dutch 
workmanship, and the Inscriptions and 
style show that it was made early to 
the eighteenth century, The vessel is 
remarkable because it ls known tn the 
museum, says a Berlin paper, “as hav- 
ing consumption which can be com- 
municated to other objects of glass, 
On that account it is Isolated, There 
fre remedies against this glass disease, 
which ts usually developed because of 
defects In the glass mixture, but these 
have not been applied to the Dutch 
vessel In order that the progress of the 
wasting disease may be observed.” 

A Big Calculation in Water. 

ocean, sea and lake surface of 
our planet Is estimated at something 
like 145,000,000 square miles, with an 
average depth of 12,000 feet, aud ts 
calculated to contain not less than 
6,270,000,000,000,000 tons of water, 
The rivers of the earth aro estimated 
to have a flow sufficient to cover thir- 
ty-aix cuble miles of the above area 
tach day. Now, If all the oceans were 
buddenly dried and the rivers could 
keep up thelr present rate of flow, 
which, of course, they could not with- 
but ocean evaporation, !t would take 
6,500 years to refill the basin,

It Is well known, says Knowledge, 
that certain kinds of fishes are able te 
live out of water much longer than 
others, the power being dependent 
upon the length of time that their gills 
are capable of remaining damp. So 
long as this condition lasts fish are able 
to obtain the necessary amount of oxy- 
gen from the alr through the medium 
of the water spread over the fine mem- 
brane of the gills, Recently a German 
has Invented an apparatus by means 
of which the gills can be kept molst for 
an indefinite period, This apparatus 
consists of a wooden box with a num- 
ber of compartments corresponding 
with the size of the fishes, On the floor 
of each compartment is a layer half an 
inch deep of cloths saturated with wa- 
ter which by evaporation keeps the at- 
mosphere moist, The gills of the fishes 
are thus kept damp, while oxygen |s

PREMIER BOND PROTESTS. 

Says Newfoundiand Is Sacrificed to 
Americhn Interests, 

Sir Robert Bond, Premier of New- 
foundland, contrary to ex tion, 
succeeded in getting the Newfound- 
land fishery question before the Col 
onial Conference. 

ir Robert moved a resolution to the 
effect that if the Home Government 
failed to support the colonies in car- 
rying out local statutes, but suspend- 
ed of abrogated them at the instance 
of a foreign power, this act would 
constitute a serious infringement of 
autonomous Bye oy 

He ar; that the assent of the 
crown should be given to the act 
1906; that the colony should not be 
fettered by any modus vivendi in car- 

ing out laws approved by it, and 
that the Home Government should 

proceed to define the rights of Am- 
crlean citizens under the treaty 
1818, which, he declared, Newfound- 
land did not want to limit in any way, 
she merely sought justice. 

The resolution was placed on the re- 
cords of the conference, 

The Mail says that Premier Bond 
pleaded earnestly with Lord Elgin for 
nearly two hours, saying, “Unless 
something is done, we shall starve.” 
Elgin, however refused the “pathetic 
appeal of Newfoundland.” e Mail 
continues that Bond nag, f jump- 
ed to his feet, eaying, “It is gross 
humiliation and neglect, which you 
would not dare to offer to a colony 
powerful enough to give effect to its 
resentment, 

“It is most unjust, and TI repeat 
peain that ps are deliberately neg- 
oe us for the sake of American 
nteres 

Gatherin up his papers, the New- 
foundland Premier left the room with- 
out uttering another word, <A few 
minutes later the other Premiers 
emerged, excitedly discussing the in- 
cident. The general feeling was that 
Bond has been badly treated.

saying the Home Government will do 
nothing in connection with the New- 
foundiand fisheries. An editorial ar-

FILL COAL BIN: 

«4 SUMMER 

Timely Advice Given on the Fue! 
ubject by W. H. Aldridge 
W. H .Aldridge, manager director 

of the Pacific Coal Co., in an inter- 
view yore, said: 

“The difficulties in the western 
coal fields have been settled for 
years, and it is only a question oi 
getting sufficient men to enable the 
coal companies to amply supply the 
public, the industries and the rail- 
ways. Some of the coal companies 

wo 

are short of men at the present time, , 

but it is hoped that this shortage | 

will be made up 

month or two, 
“One important cause for the coal 

during the next 

of shortage last winter was due to the 

public waiting until fall before lay- 
ing in their winter supply. During 
last summer a number of the mines 
did not have sufficient orders to oper- 

ate over three or four days a week, 

of and in the fall the coal companies |

had more orders than could possibly 
filled, 

“The severe weather later in the 
season made it impossible for the 
railways to handle all the traffic and 
supply sufficient cars, and it was 
equally difficult for the coal com- 
panies to operate to their fullest ca- 
pacity under the severe weather con- 
ditions. 

“If the public will, so far as 
sible, take their coal supply during 
jthe summer months, when weather 
conditions are favorable for both rail- 
ways and mines, there need no 
fear of any coal shortage during the 
coming winter.”—Manitoba Free

A curious aud regrettable revival of 
the word “draw” in the sense of “with- 
draw” occurs in “drawing room,” Here 
the original meaning of the word is 
lost because of ita lamentable pronan 
clation by the uneducated, Nobody, 
hearing it mentioned as “droying 
room” at its best or ag “droring room” 
at its worst,” would suspect It of being 
a room to which to withdraw for relax- 
ation, Most words of the kind, though, 
have no better claim to our admiration, 
and many have a worse one to our 
sense of language. “Parlor” is an ugly 
growth from the old monasterial “par- 
lolr,” or room where speaking was al- 
lowed, and “bosdolr,” that early Victo- 
rian expression of gentility, began by 
being a room to sulk in, “Sitting room”

of cause and effect, and so ts “living

Liquor Laws in Norway | 
New Norwegian liquor laws are 
successful. The Sondag system gives | 
power to municipalities % grant all 
the retail spirit licenses which they 
eem necessary to a company which 
would bind itself to carry on tne 
traffic in the interests of the com- 
munity, with a fixed annual return 
of not more than 6 per cent on its 
paid up capital, 

In establishing the system the 
question of compensation dves not 
appear to have presented much dith- 
culty. The allotments of the protite | 
are as follows: To the state, 66 pei | 
cent; to the municipality, in lieu oi 
larger license duties, now abolished, 
15 per cent; to objects of public 
utility operatin as counter attrac- 
tions to the public houses in towns, 
10 per cent, and in the surrounding 
districts, 10 per cent. 

The profits of the trade under 
these restrictions have contributed 
$7,000,000 for objects of public in- 
terest since the founding of the sys- 
tem. Dur'ng the last eight years the 
proportion accruing to the state has 
been increased and set apart until 
1910 to form the nucleus of an old 
age pension fund, which amounts 
how to $2,300,000, The most remark- 
able fact in the history of Norway 
sobriety is that the consumption ot 
alcohol per inhabitant has decreased 
about 45 per cent in the last fifty 
years. The decrease has been most 
marked since the establishment of 
the Sondag system. 

The sims and principles of the 
Sondag system are these: The elimi- 
nation of private profit and securing 
the monopoly value for the public; 
insuring highest quality of liquors 
sold; the reduction of the number of 
licenses ; the easy enforcement of

A Spanish Brigand 
Strange tales are being told in Cor 
dova, Spain, of the exploita of the 
brigand Pernales, who holds entire 
villages to ransom and extracts 
money by the most amazing tricks, 
include the assumption of 
wizardry, Not long ago he took up 
a position of observation about a 
mile and a half from the village of

servants of various proprietors, he 
ordered them to bring him a sum 
equivalent to $90 from each, and in

Strange as it sounds, the

to execute the command, end the | 
proprietors as tamely sent the money, | 
which the brigand spent the reat of 
the day collecting as it waa brought} 
to him, while he lounged smoking

the brigand ia reported from Villau, | 

where he successfully extorted nell

ONTARIU-QUEBEC CUBALT MIN- 
ING CO,, LIMITED 
Have Secured Options on Adjoining 
Properties, Thus Causing Consi 
erable Comment in Cobalt Circles 
The Ontario-Quebee Cobalt Mining 
Company, Limited, has not issued 
much information lately as to the 
condition of their properties in 
Bucke township, and they now claim 
that this action has been part of a 
coupe which the officers have had up 

their sleeves for months past. The 
veins that were uncovered during 
the earliest operations looked so 

good and the reports of the various 
mining engineers and experts who 
examined the property were #0 pro- 
mising that the officers decided to 
maintain secrecy until they could 
obtain options on the properties im- 
mediately surrounding their mines. 
These options have now been secur. 
ed, it is understood, at reasonable 
figures, and recent reporta are bein 
made public. The company's ohiet 
engineer, Mr. A. EK. Hogg, M.E., in} 
his latest report recommends that 
the main shaft be at once sunk to! 
the 160-foot level, where the richest 
ores in the section have been encoun- 
tered, and the directors have prac- 
tically decided to follow his recom- 
mendations. The Hon. L. J. Le 
brosse also inspected the Ontario- 
Quebec Cobalt properties a few days 

ago, and his report is extremely} 
gratifying to the directors of the! 
company. The officers of the com- 

pany expect the Ontario-Quebee Co- 
malt Mining company to become a 
heavy shipper in the near future, 
Machinery ordered during the win- 
ter is now on the way to the pro 
perty, and will be in working shape 
within a few weeks, At the present

Nobody Ever “at” London. 

A cnee of irregularity occurs In a 
cablegram that announces from New 
York the residence of a certain ac 
cused person “at London.” You will 
perceive at once the absurdity of those 
words--“at London.” A New Yorker 
may want to get at London, but those 
who live there live “In London.” And 
it is one of the triumphs of London 
and language (though most Irregular) 
that no one is ever “at” London. You 
can drop off “at” Parla on the way to 
anywhere, and you may spend the win 
ter “at” St, Petersburg of “at” New 
York. You may change cars “at” Chi 
cago, But there comes a moment when 
the English language ete irregular, t« 
it when the fifth million is passed? No 
Englishtoan was ever “at’ London, It 
would be os irremular as being “at”

GURRENT COMMENT. 

The City Council this morhing de- 
vided to recommend Geo, F. Downes 
for the position of police magistrate 
Mr. Downes is a gentleman in every 
way fitted to discharge the duties of 

The position is limited by the ley 
islature of che provines to & metiber 

lawyers care to give the time from 

The position requires a legal mind, 
We 

are not sure that it is mot more so 

We believe the appointment, as has 
been said, will be both popular and 
satisfactory. 

The salary attached, $25 a month, 
however, is in our opinion alto- 
gether inadequate, The dignity of 
the position and the desire of the 
city Rot to be charged with penur- 
jousness would have suggested at 
least $50 per month, 

Our attention has been drawn to 
several cases of defacement or de- 
struction of tradeemen's «signe, by 
some person or persons unknown. In 
one inetance the gold lettering on an 
expensive and artistic sign had been 
gone over with a pencil and oblit- 
erated, while in another case a drum 
sign had been broken and practically 
destroyed, These acts were in all 
probability prompted by a spirit of 
mischief rather than malice, but pone 
the less it ie a pity that the perpe- 
trator cannot be caught amd made an 
example of,

are that the concern will start out 
with a good trade throughout. The 
line of manufacture will include all 

goods monulactured in their Toronto 
and Montreal shops, the trade of the 
concern being so great that the out 
put of the latter shops will be con 
sumed almost immediately, The peo- 
ple of West Fort William are lookin 
for great things from the operatic 
of this, the biggest industry of the

C.P.R. Press Tele- 
graph Rates Doubled 

Oct 2.—The © 
Pelegraph Company has increased 
their rates at & moment's notice, 
The new echedule increases the day 
rate from Western Ontario 100 per 
cent., increases the day rate from 
Alberta 100 per cent,, increases the 
night rate from Alberta 114 per 
cent., increases the day rate from 
Saskatchewan 114 per cent,, increases 
the night rate from Saskatchewan 
100 per com, 

The Free Press to-day published a 
strongly condemnatory editorial, es- 
pecially condemning, the fact that the 
rates were made retro-active, It says 
in part: ‘It is not very long since 
the ©, P. RR, Telegraph Company 
cancelled « press rate from Toronto 
to Winnipeg which had been in exist 
ence for over qa doren years, The new 
achedule increased the night press 
rate 66 per cemt., and the day ji: 
rate 283 per cent,, only 283 per cent, 
In this case the C, P, R, Telegraph 
Company did not make the new rato 
imanediately effective as is the prea 
ent care, They made it retroactive, 
They dated it back, The Imperial 
ukase, mandate, reseript, or what 
eVer you choose to call it, instructed 
the newspaper that they would be 
called upon to pay this additional 
66 per cent, and 238 per cent, from 
a date in the past, which was duly 
set forth, Upon the newspapers 
mildly pointing out that this was 
hardly in accordance with the rules 
of the game the great men who guide 
the destinies of the telegraph mon- 
opoly relapsed into a haughty silence 
and sent in thelr bills, The thanks, 
hearty thanks, of the public are due 
to these gentlemen for establishing, 
by thelr conduct, the case for ex- 
tending the authority of the railway 
jcommission over the telegraph com- 
jpanies, The case is already strong, 
but we are not without hapes that 
they will make it overwhelming by 
some crowning act of autocracy and 
imbecility,"’ '
