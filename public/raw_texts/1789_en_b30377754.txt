TO THE 

RIGHT REVEREND, 

S A M U E L, 

LORD BISHOP of St. DAVIDS 

My Lord, 

WHEN your Lordfhip's late fermon on 
! The Principle ^/Vitality in Man9 
was announced to the public, my curiolity was 
railed in no fmall degree. The fubjedt of this 
difcourfe, one of the molt intereftingin phyfics, 
or theology ; the objedt of it, to affift one of 
ihe moft benevolent inftitutions, that has done 
honour to our country or common nature j 
and your Lordlhip’s high rank and character, 
all concurred to enforce a clofe attention to 
this performance. How I have been affedted 

A 3 in 

( 6 ) 

in the perufal of it, the following remarks 
will fufficiently explain. In delivering them, 

I {hall aim at no other arrangement than that 
which your Lordfhip’s own method naturally 
fuggefts 5 and for the freedom I fhall ufe, no 
apology can be neceffary to one, who, by his 
own practice, has given a fandtion to far greater 
liberties than I fhall prefume to take. 

Having introduced your fubjedt, by lament¬ 
ing “ the unnatural war between faith and 
reafon, between human fcience and divine,’" 
to which the miftaken zeal of Tome has given 
occafion, your Lordfhip proceeds (p. 6 — -8.) as 
follows : — 

“ It is moft certain that a Divine Revelation, 
if any be extant in the world ; a Divine 
€< Revelation, which is, in other words, a 
difcovery of feme part of God’s own know- 
ledge, made by God himfelf, notwithftand- 
<€ ing that fallible men have been made the in- 
“ ftruments of the communication, muft be 
“ perfedtly free from all mixture of human 
“ ignorance and error, in the particular fub- 
“ jedt in which the difcovery is made. The 
difcovery may, and unlefs the powers of the 
** human mind were infinite*. it cannot but be 

** limited 

. ( 7 ) 

limited and partial : but as far as it extends, 
it mu ft be accurate. For a falfe propofttion, 
or a miftake, is certainly the very reverfe of 
a difcovery. — -In whatever relates therefore 
to religion, either in theory or practice, the 
knowledge of the facred writers was infalli¬ 
ble, as far as it extended, or their infpira- 
tion had been a mere pretence. And in the 
whole extent of that fubjedt, faith mu ft be 
renounced, or reafon mu ft fubmit implicitly 
to their oracular deciftons. But in other 
fubjedts, not immediately connected with 
theology or morals, it is by. no means cer¬ 
tain, that their minds were equally en¬ 
lightened, or that they were even preferved 
from grofs errors. It is certain, on the 
contrary, that the Prophets and Apoftles 
might be fufficiently qualified for the talk, 
afligned them, to be teachers of that wifi- 
dom which maketh wife unto falvationfi* 

i 

although in the ftrudture and mechanifim of 
the material world, they were lefs informed 
than Copernicus, or Newton, and were lefs 
knowing than Harvey in the animal ceco- 
nomy. Want of information, and error of 
opinion in the profane fciences, may, for any 

A 4 * <( thing 

( 8 ) 

thing that appears to the contrary, be per- 
“ feftly confident with the plenary infpira- 
“ tion of a religious teacher ; lince it is not 
“ all knowledge, but religious knowledge 
“ only, that fuch a teacher is fent to propa- 
<<r gate and improve/5 It was a long time, 
my Lord, before I could perfuade myfelf that 
thefe fentences had really dropped from your 
pen. Nothing lefs than the authority of your 
name in the title-page, could convince me that 
I was not imbibing the mod: malignant poi- 
fon. yet prepared by your heretical adverfar y. 
The page feems plucked from that volume of 
perdition. The Theological Repojitory . What, 
my Lord, is not all Scripture given by the in- 
Jpiration of God ? And were not the writers 
of it led by the Holy Spirit into all Truth ? 
If, with your Lordfhip, we limit their infal¬ 
libility on any points, (which is fomewhat like 
limiting infinity,} where fhali we flop ? To 
contend that the knowledge of the Sacred Wri¬ 
ters was infallible, as far as it extended, is only 
faying, that they knew what they were not 
ignorant of. If the whole fcheme of Revela¬ 
tion was not underftood by them, it will be 
difficult ' to xliew how they could avoid mif- 

taking 

( 9 ) 

taking feveral parts of it ; all the parts having 
a neceffary connection and mutual dependance. 
It is in vain to make an exception of fubjeCts 
unconnected with religion. We do not cer¬ 
tainly know what thofe fubjeCts are. They 
are different according to the apprehenfions of 
different men : and affuredly, in the opinion 
of many ferious Chriftians, as well as in that 
of your Lordfhip, the principle of vitality 
in man , and the nature of death , are not in¬ 
cluded in the number. My Lord, I would 
willingly draw you from the precipice on the 
brink of which you ftand. I would exhort 
you, by a timely retractation, to avoid being 
compelled by an immediate deduction from 
your own politicos, to join the party of the 
Her ef arch , and to own with him, that 6S No 
“ meffenger from God is to be confidered as 
“ infpired by him, any further than he him- 
“ felf pretends to be fo, or than the objeCt of 
44 his million required. In other things, if he 
“ was a mere man, he muft have been as fal- 
<c lible as other men, who had enjoyed ad van- 
u tages for knowledge equal to his.” ^

Your Lordfhip goes on, (p. 9, 10.) “ But 
*c though I admit the poffibility of an Infpired 
“ Teacher's error of opinion, in fubjefts 
“ which he is not fent to teach, ^becaufe In- 
“ fpiration is not omnifcience, and fome things 
“ there mud be which it will leave untaught) ; 

(t and every man's liberty ; and proteft againft

“ to alien t to a philofophical opinion inciden-

cc St. Paul, upon the authority of their infal- 
“ libility in divine knowledge ; though 1 think

of the Platonic Philofophy as peculiarly ufeful in illuftrating what 
he fuppofes to be the doftrines of the Chriftian fcriptures. What 
ail edifying difcuflion of this Alliance of Platonifm with Chrif- 
tianity might be imagined in a dialogue between the Bp. of 
St. David’s, Lord Monboddo, midi Mr. Thomas Taylor, 
the late cf ranfaior of Proclus ! Thefe philofophic heroes, though 
a little out of date in the end of the eighteenth century,

( ” ) 

€C be openly after ted, and mod pertinacioufly 
<c maintained ; yet I confefs, it appears to me 
“ no very probable fuppolition, and it is, as I 
conceive, a mere foppofition, not yet con- 
“ firmed by any one clear inftance, that an 
“ Infpired Writer fhould be permitted in his 
“ religious difcourfes, to affirm a falfe propo- 
tc fition in any fubjedt, or in any hiftory to 
“ mifrep refen t a fact; fo that 1 would not 
“ eafily, nor indeed without the convidtion of 
“ the mod cogent proof, embrace any notion 
*e in philofophy, or attend to any hiftorical re- 
“ lation, which fhould be evidently, and in 
** itfelf, repugnant to an explicit affertion 
*€ of any of the facred waiters/' — Perhaps 
your Lordfhip here intends to give fome fpe- 
cimen of the retradtation I have recommended- 
The general inconfiftency of this paffage with 
that which precedes it, is fufficiently obvi¬ 
ous ; but every contradidtion is not a recanta¬ 
tion. I mud, however, confefs my lei f unable 
to dif cover any eifential difference between that 
divine fuperiritendaiice which prevents a wai¬ 
ter in his religious difcourfes from affirming 

\ 

“ a falfe proportion in any fubjedt/5 or mif- 
reprefenting a fadl in any hiftory/5 and that 
plenary infpiration which leads into all truth 

on 

( 12 ) 

on every topic of human inveftigation or dif- 
cuffion. If your Lordihip had condefcended to 
point out the difference between thefe ideas, 
I fhould have known on what ground to meet 
the arguments you afterwards deduce from 
the letter of holy writ. As the cafe ftands, 
I dial! briefly review thofe arguments on your 
iaft fuppofition that the facred writers were not 
permitted to affirm a falfe propofition in any 
fubjedl At the fame time I acknowledge, that 
I entirely accede to your Lordfhip/s former 
philofophical, though fomewhat heretical con- 
cefiions, “ that the prophets and apoilles 
“ might be fufficiently qualified for the talk 
affigned them, although in the ftrudture and 
mechanifm of the material world they were 
lefs informed than Copernicus or Newton, 
and were lefs knowing than Harvey in the 
ts animal (Economy. 

Your 

* This, however, fo far as relates to Solomon, the Bp. of St. D. 
will not allow. [See Sermon , p. 20, 21.] On this matter I beg 
to offer his Lordfhip the following remark of the late Baron 
Haller, who is thought by feme to have been a tolerable 
judge of fuch fubjecds. t( Sunt qui Salomqni circuiium fan- 
“ guinis non ignotum fuiffe feripferint. Ufi funt, ad hanc lau- 
“ dem vetuftiflimo regi vindieandam, rota? vocabulo, quo aliquid 
“ circumeuns intelligt credunt. Verum nihil aliud certe hie vo- 
“ luit Divus ille, prater aquae defeftum, quse ex fonte hauriri 

“ nequeat. 

( i3 ) 

Your Lordfhip having compared the words 
of your text (Ecclefi xii. 7. Then [hall the dufi 
return to the earth as it was ; and the fpirit 
jhall return unto God who gave it •) with the 
account given of the creation of man by Mofes 
(Gen, xi. 7. And the Lord God formed man 
of the dufi of the ground, and breathed into his 
nofirils the breath of life ; and man became a 
living foul), proceeds ^p. 17)? It is the 
“ explicit ailertion therefore both of Moles 
iC and of Solomon, that man is a compound 
“ of body and foul 3 and that the union of 
“ the immaterial foul with the bodv, is the 
4i true principle of vitality in the human fpe- 
“ cies, And this account of man is folemnly 
** delivered by them both, as a branch of their 
g( religious dodtrine.” I do not ftay to afk 
your Lordihip how you know this account to 
be a branch of their religious doctrine : it is 
my prefen t bufinefs to fuppofe it fuch. On 
the fame authority I muft fuppofe the union 
of the immaterial foul with the body to be the

tion. Gen. vii. 15. Two and two of all

All in whole nofrils was the breath of life 

m - and every living fnbjlance was defrayed 

— both man , and cattle > and the creep¬ 
ing things , and the fowl of heaven . Ecclef. 
iii. 19. For that which befalleth the fans of 
men befalleth beefs —ye a they have all one 
breath , fo that a mail hath no pre-eminence 
above a beaf . v. 21. Who knoweth the fpirit 
of man that goeth upward , and the fpirit of the 
beaf that goeth downward to the earth ? 

Your Lordffiip thinks that the words which 
we render “ the breath of life/5 might more 
properly be translated the breath of immor¬ 
tality/5 it being the fame expreffion which in 
Job xxxiL 8. is rendered “ the injpiration of 
<c the Almighty /’ 1 Should be forry to pufh 

vour Lordffiip into thofe difficulties to which 
your literal acceptation of the laft mentioned 
figurative text would render you liable. I 
Shall be content with obferving, that St. Paul 
appears to have thought differently, and to 
have fuppofed that to the firft created man 
there did not belong any inherent immortality.

Adam was made a living foul ; the lajl Adam 
was made a quickening Jpirit. 

Not for your fake, my Lord, who move in 
a fphere far above the inferior writers I am 
going to cite, but for that of the reader, I fhall 
tranfcribe fome obfervations on the expreffions 
and texts above mentioned, fuggefted by a 
mode of interpretation very different from that 
which your Lordihlp has thought proper to 
adopt. On which hde fimplicity, clearnefs, 
and accommodation to the general language of 
fcripture appear to lie, is a queflion I will¬ 
ingly leave to the decilion of competent 
judges.

“ The hiftory of the creation of man is 
fuccindlly delivered in Gen. ii. 7. And the 
s< Lord God formed man of the duf of the 
ground , and breathed into his nojlrils the 
cc breath of life , and man became a living foul. 
<c We fee here, that the whole man (for nothing 
“ is faid of his body in particular) was made of

41 s When the whole man was completely 
formed* and not before* we are next in- 
formed* that God made this man, who was 
62 If clefs at firft, to breathe and live. For it 
evidently follows from the text* that nothing 
but the circumftance of breathing , made the 
difference between the unanimated earth * 
and the living foul . It is not faid that 

when one ccnftituent part of the man was 
“ made* another neceffary conftituent part of a 
fe very different nature* was fuperadded to it ; 
61 and that thofe two united* conftituted the 
<c man ; but only that that fubftance which 
was formed of the duft of the earth became 
a living foul , that is, became alive, by be- 
ing made to breathe \ 

“ That no- ftrefs is to be laid upon the 
ec word which we tranflate foul (though 
it would be moil of all abfurd to fuppofe,

tion of this paffage, that the dujl of the earth 
“ could be converted into an immaterial foul)

immaterial foul with the body is the true 
principle of vitality in the human fpecies ; and 
if I be not miftaken in my conclufion that on 
this fuppolition brute animals owe their vitality 
to the fame principle, we fhall encounter with 
another true principle pf vitality delivered in the 
writings of Mofes in language no lefs explicit 
than that on wdiich your Lordfhip’s argument 
Is founded. This other principle is nothing

ferred your hearers to any paflage in the New 
Tef ament containing an explicit affertion 66 that 
“ man is a compound of body and foul, and 
that the union of the immaterial foul with 
“ the body is the true principle of vitality in 
“ the human fpecies.” Whether your Lord- 
(hip’s main argument is the better or the worfe 
for this inftance of referve, it is not to my pre¬ 
fen t purpofe to inquire ^ but I think I may 
draw from it the probable conclufion that your 
Lordfhip could not find in the books of the New

ing the reader’s attention, that this opinion of the principle of 
life, belonging efpecially to the blood , appears to have been en¬ 
tertained by our great countryman, Harvey, as it is by fome 
of the moll enlightened phyliologills of the prefent time 5 viz. 
Mr. Hunter, Dr. G„ Fordyce, &c, &c.

Teftament any paffage that you judged to con¬ 
tain fuch an affertion . 

I now proceed to offer fome remarks on the 
phyfiological part of your Lordfhip’s difcourfe ; 
and, as before, mu ft begin with a long quota¬ 
tion ; for no language but your own can do 
juftice to the thoughts. 

“ Although we mufi believe, if we believe 
£<r our Bible, that the union of the foul and 
body is the firil principle of animation 
“ in the human fubjed ; it is by no means a 
neceffary confequence, that the life of man 
is in no degree and in no part mechanical. 
66 Since man is declared to be a compound, the 
natural prefumption feems to be, that the 
<£ life of this compounded being is itfelf a 
compound. And this experience and ob- 
“ fervation prove to be indeed the cafe. Man’s 
life is compounded of the life of the intel- 
“ led: and the animal life. The life of the 
“ intelled is limply intelligence, or the ener- 
“ gy of the intelligent principle. The ani- 
4< mal life is itfelf a compound, confiding of 

** the 

[ 27 3 

*s the vegetable life combined with the prin- 
“ ciple of perception,. Human life therefore 
is an aggregate of at lead three ingredients : 
“ intelligence, perception and vegetation. The 
“ lowed and the lad of tbefe, the vegetable 
(C life, is wholly in the body, and is mere me- 
“ chanifm ^ not a mechanifm which any hu- 
cc man ingenuity may imitate, or even to any 
“ good degree explore ; but the exquifite me- 
“ chanifm of a divine artificer. Still it is me- 
chanifm ; confiding in a fymmetry and fym- 
€C pa thy of parts,, and a correfpondence of mo- 
tions conducive, by mechanical laws, eda- 
“ blifhed by the Creator’s wifdom, to the 
“ growth, nourishment, and confer vation of 
“ the whole. The wheels of this wonderful 
“ machine are fet a-going, as the fcriptures 
iC teach us, by the prefence of the immaterial 
foul ; which is therefore not only the feat of 
intelligence, but the fource and center of 
“ the man’s entire animation.” ( Sermon r p. 
1 8, 19.) 

Here I fee with concern your Lordfhip drag¬ 
gling amidd innumerable difficulties, commit¬ 
ted with innumerable adverfaries of the medi¬ 
cal profeffion. Heathen and Chridian, orthodox

and heterodox, and contradidled even by the 
motto you have prefixed to your difcourfe. As 
this laft circumftance is the moft remarkable, 
and argues no common degree of inattention 
in your Lordfhip, I fhall begin with it. The 
vegetable life of the body according to your 
Lordfhip, is “ mere mechariifm, confifling in 
44 a correfpondence of motions conducive to 
“ the growth, nourifhment and confervation 
(C of the whole”- — “ It is in this circumftance 

i 

only, namely, that the immaterial mover is 
“ itfelf attached to the machine, that the ve- 
*c getable life of the body, confidered as a dif- 
tindl thing, as in itfelf it is, from the two 
44 principles of intelligence and perception, 
44 differs in kind from mere clock-work.” (p. 
19.) Your Lordfhip therefore muft believe 
that where the fundtions of intelligence and 
perception are not concerned, (and they certain¬ 
ly are not concerned in many of the motions 
conducive to the growth, nourifhment, and 
confervation of the body, inafmueh as we 
have not the fmalleft confeioufhefs of them,) 
the life of the body does not differ from mere 
clock-work. How this is to be reconciled 
with vour motto from Dr. Nicholls, which, 

for 

- 1

/ 

[ 29 1 

for the reader’s convenience, I tranfcribe be¬ 
low *, I leave to your Lordfhip to difcover. 

Your Lordfhip needs not to be informed, that 
Dr» Nicholls was of the Stahlian fed: of 
phyficians, and, according to the dillinguifti- 
ing tenets of that fed:, attributed the motions 
conducive to the growth, nourifhment, and 
confervation of the body, to the influence and 
volitions of the rational foul ; the fame thing, 
I fuppofe, with your Lordfhip’s principle of 
intelligence . 

Now, of the various principles or terms 
invented to explain the phenomena of animal 

life, from the t# ivopfAuvrx of Hippocrates,

the 'ZCMVfiCC of Aretjeus, and the (pv<ri$ of Ga¬ 
len, down to the Anima Me die a of Nicholls, 
the vis infta of Haller, and the original

G. Fordyce, though fome of thefe have a 
clofer relation to the principle of intelligence

than 

[ 3° ] 

than others, each difclaims any even the moft 
remote alliance with your Lordfhip’s clock- 
mechanifm 

* 44 In any fyftem of bodies, or particles of matter, affeding 
44 one another only by the motions already exifting in them be- 
** ing communicated to one another, they may diminilh their 
motion, or bring one another to reft ; but they never can in- 
44 creafe the motion exifting in the whole. It happens fre- 
44 quently, that the motions in the animal body are increafed, 
44 without any alteration of external applications to it : the 
44 cafes are fo numerous, that it is hardly worth bringing an ex~ 
ample; we might mention the increafe at times, of the circu- 
“ lation, and all the motions of the fluids, without the leaft new 
44 motion in the furrounding bodies, or interference, or even 
knowledge of the mind. This motion mu ft therefore be ori« 
at ginal, and not communicated. 

44 In communicated motion, if one body be at reft, and a 
* ‘ motion be communicated to it by another, the power of the 
44 whole motion fhall not be greater than that in the communk 
“ eating body at the time of the communication. If I take out 
44 the heart of an animal, cut off the auricles, it will in many 
44 cafes continue to contract and dilate for fome time. If it be 
** left to come to reft, and if foon after a needle be introduced 
“ into the ventricle, placed tranfverfely, and if the interior fur- 
face of the ventricle be pricked gently by the needle, the ven- 
et tricle will contrad with fuch power as to force the needle deep 
44 into it : in this cafe, the force of the contradion of the ven- 
6< tricle is much greater than the power with, which it was 
44 pricked by the needle; this contradion was therefore not 
44 communicated to it by the moving needle, but was generated, 
94 and therefore an original motion.5’ Dr. G. Fordyce, Phil, 

' 'TravJ, \ vol. lxxviii, p. 24. — I fuppofe it will be allowed, that 
the motion of clock-work is communicated motion . 

But 

[ 3' 3 

But I may have mifrep refen ted your mean¬ 
ing ; (not, I can affure you, through defign, but 
from a misfortune, which I believe I fhall 
fhare in common with many of your Lordfhip’s 
readers ;) for to this mecha^ifm you fay, 
**' the immaterial mover is attached, and it is 
** in this circumftance only that the vegetable 
“ life of the body, confidered as a diftindt 
“ thing, as in itfelf it is, from the two 
principles of intelligence and perception, 
u differs in kind from mere clock-work.” 
(p. 19.) 

I with I had {kill enough to unravel this 
curious web of argument, and to prefen t its 
feparate filaments to the reader’s eye : but this 
I find impoffible. In what refpedt, my Lord, 
does the union of the immaterial mover with 
the material machine, make the latter different 
from what it would be independently of fuch 
union, except that in one cafe it would have 
motion, and in the other it would be motion- 
lefs ? If the wheels of this exquifite machine 
be fet in motion by the prefence of the imma¬ 
terial foul, of what ufe or confequence is the 
vegetable life ? Or in what refpedt would the 

human 

I 

I 

[ 32 ] 

human body be worfe provided than it is, were 
there no fuch thing ? 

Does the vegetable life derive its energies 
from the immaterial foul ? If it do not thence 
derive them, it^ muft either be deftitute of any 
energies, and consequently be nothing ; or it 
muft have energies of its own, and confe- 
quently Hand in no need of the affiftance of 
the immaterial principle. I conclude, there¬ 
fore, that, according to your Lordfhip, the 
vegetable life is a compound refultmg from 
the union of mechanifm with the immaterial 
principle. But, on the other hand, this fup- 
pofition makes the vegetable life encroach 
fbmewhat on the principles of animal life ; 
and your Lordfhip fays explicitly, that the ve¬ 
getable life is a diftinft thing from the two 
principles of intelligence and perception— on 
which fide foever we turn, all is inextricable 
confufion, or impenetrable darknefs y

Further ; of the animal life your Lordfhip's 
opinion is, (I beg pardon, my Lord y it is 

impoffible 

/ 

( 33 ) 

impoffible to know what your opinion is on 
thefe fubjedts, but you fay,) that it “ is itfelf 
“ a compound, coniifting of the vegetable life 
<c combined with the principle of perception.” 
This laft is, of courfe, an immaterial principle,. 
Pray, my Lord, is it the fame with the principle 
of intelligence (the “ breath of life” and “ of 
immortality” [p. 1 5-])> or is it different? If it 
be different, we have an hypoftatic union of two 
immaterial principles or fouls in one human 
body. I have no doubt that your Lordfhip's 
philofophy is equal to this : I am furprifed at 
its not mounting higher. Your own favourite 
Plato would have fupplied you with a triad 
of principles and this number I fhould 
judge to be peculiarly fuited to your Lord- 
fhip's tafte.'f* If, my Lord, you determine the

each of the functions enumerated by thefe fages, having as 
good a claim to the title and individuality of immaterial princi¬ 
ples as the Bishop of St. David’s two leading ones of intelli¬ 
gence and perception . To atone for this jargon, I beg the rea¬

intelligent and perceptive principle to be one 
end the fame thing ; I cannot give the medi¬ 
cal reader a clearer notion of your fyfiem of 
phyfiology, than by comparing your animal 
life to a compound fait, confifting of the ve¬ 
getable life iuperfaturated (in the language of 
the chemifts) with the principle of intelli¬ 
gence. 

As I mean to follow your Lordfhip*s fteps 
as daftly as 1 can, I find myfelf obliged again 
to advert to your interpretation of fcripture, 
before I examine the application which you 
have made of your phyfiology to the theory 
of the re-animation of human bodies appa¬ 
rently dead* 

The 20th page of your Lordfhip's fermon 
begins as follows. c< This mechanifm of life, 

in that part which belongs to the body, fo 
“ evident to the anatomift and phyfician, and 

&< animum, et hoc effe nomen totum inane, fruftraque animalia

“ fo obvious indeed to common obfervation, is 
<* fo little repugnant to holy writ, that it is 
“ clearly implied in many paflages. It is im- 
“ plied in the exprefiions in which Mofes dc- 
“ fcribes the animation of the firft man ; 
“ which, though it be referred to the union 
“ of foul and body as a principle, is defcribed, 
however, in exprefiions which allude to the 
“ mechanical addon of the air, entering at the 
“ noftrils, upon the pulmonary coats.” Im- 
“ plied !” (c referred to !” ‘ ‘ allude to T Thefe, 
my Lord, are cold, fceptical, unfatisfadory ex¬ 
prefiions ; quite void of your Lordfhip’s wonted 
energy, which I am perfuaded nothing would 
have reftrained on a fubjed like this, but the 
confcioufnefs of infirmity and doubt. In the 
pafiage referred to, does the facred hiftorian de- 
fcribe one thing, or the other, or both ? Or 
does he only conceal the higher fenfe under 
the familiar exprefiion ? Or, (which I think as 
reafonable a fuppofition as any of your Lord- 
fhip’s) did the hiftorian’s principle of intelli¬ 
gence contemplate the fublime and eternal 
truths which your Lordfhip has iince more

fully revealed, while his lower principle of per¬ 
ception reded on the grofs and palpable image 
of refpiration ,? But, my Lord, I with, if pod- 
Able, to be ferioas through the remainder of 
this addrefs, in which I (hall briefly confider 
how far your Lordfhip’s theory will go to ex¬ 
plain fo me of the fadts connected with fufpencL 
ed and rebored life, 

Here again I mud tranfcribe from your 
Lordfhip. “ Since human life is undeniably 
a compound of the three principles of In- 
“ telligence. Perception, and Vegetation 3 
notwithftanding that the vegetable life be in 
*e itfelf mechanical, it will by no means be a 
€<r necelfary concluiion, that a man mud be 
“ truly and irrecoverably dead, fo foon as the 
<c figns of this vegetable life are no longer 
difcernible in his body. Pi ere Solomon's

which Mofes makes the principle of vita-

^ Why fubfequent ? No better reafon can, I believe, be af- 
figned for this, than what is founded on the unavoidable circum- 
ftance of the latter member of the fentence coming after the 
former. If we prefs the Royal Preacher’s language fo clofely, 
we mult fuppofe him to mean that the foul does not quit the 
body , till the latter be entirely dilfolved and broken down into 
its original dull, (< Then fhall the dull return to the earth as

( 38 ) 

caufe to reftore the motion, if the impedi- 
66 ment only can be removed. ” ( Serm , 
p. 22, 23.) 

I feel no fmall mortification at being 
obliged to return to your Lordfhip’s three 
principles, of which the reader by this time 
muft have had enough : he will, I truft, 
have the candour to believe that it is not to 
gratify my own inclination that I plunge 
again into this dark abyfs. 

If (according to your Lordfliip) the union 
of the immortal fpirit to the body firft fet 
the machine in motion ; and if (as you mufi: 
allow) it be in confequence of the continuance 
of that union that the motion is continued, 
what imaginable reftraint or impediment (hall 
put a flop to the motion while the union 
lafts ? The infufion of the immaterial prin¬ 
ciple, you fay, firft gave life and motion to the 
before motionlefs and inanimate clay ; and 
fhali it not prefer ve life and motion, fo long 
as that immaterial principle remains r But it 
happens, that in drowned perfons the effential 
motions of life, refpiration and the circulation 

of 

( 39 ) 

of the blood are flopped, while yet (according 
to your Lordffiip’s hypothecs) the foul re¬ 
mains in the body. 

You will fay, I know, that thefe motions 
belong only to the vegetable life, which is 
mechanical ; and, indeed, I readily grant that 
in perfons re-animated, the mechanifm is 
often fet in motion a confiderable time be¬ 
fore the principle of intelligence, or even that 
of perception, fhews any figns of adtivity. 
But here, my Lord, you will meet with equal, 
or ftill greater difficulties ; for you will be 
compelled to acknowledge either that the ener¬ 
gies of what you call the vegetable life, are fuffi- 
cient for the fupport of the vital motions of 
the body, or that the immaterial principle is 
infufficient for that fupport. I leave it to your 
Lordffiip to chufe which flde of this dilemma 
you will take. 

“ Some fpace,” your Lordffiip fays, “ may 
intervene between the flopping of the clock- 
“ work of the body’s life, and the departure 
“ of the immortal fpirit.” Of this fpace then 
your Lordffiip thinks there is a maximum . 
The reports of the Humane Society will 

ffiew 

( 4° ) 

ihew you, my Lord, that to all appearance 
this maximum in different perfons differs moft 
remarkably. Some have been reftored to life 
after a long interval of apparent death, while 
others, after a very fhort interval, have been 
found irrecoverable. The attachment then of 
the immortal fpirit to the mortal machine, 
muff in different cafes differ extremely. I with 
I knew whether your Lordfhip would allow 
fome portion of an immaterial principle, fome 
fpark of that astherial fire to the lower ani¬ 
mals ; for, afiuredly, the vegetable or mecha¬ 
nical life in quadrupeds, may be fufpended and 
reftored by the fame means as in the human 
lpecies. Your Lordfhip, perhaps, can tell us 
in what degree the prefence of an immaterial 
|bul is more requilite in one cafe than in the 
other. If the prefence of an immaterial prin¬ 
ciple conftitute the ftate of life in man and 
quadrupeds, the fame will hold good, I fup- 
pofe, in amphibious animals. Thefe have 
cold blood, and are remarkably tenacious of 
life. And your Lordfhip will allow it to be 
the effect of a tafte fome what grovelling in 
the immaterial principle, that it fhould remain 

more 

[ 4i. ] 

more clofely and intimately attached to the 
clock-mechanifm of a toad or viper, than to 
that of an archdeacon, billiop, or cardinal. 

Some other phenomena attending this (as 
it has been perhaps improperly called) middle 
ftate between life and death, are extremely 
puzzling on the hypothesis, which, accord¬ 
ing to your Lordihip, demands the implicit 
“ affent of every true believer/’ and is fo 
well eftabliihed, that “ no philofophy is to 
€e be heard that would teach the contrary.” 

It has happened to men and other animals, 
whole vital functions have been fuipended in 
confequence of drowning, of the application 
of cold, or of other caufes, that evident Signs 
of life, and fometimes of vigorous life have 
followed the application of means for their re¬ 
covery, and have fubfifted for a fhort time, and 
then hidden and abfolute death has taken place. 
In theft cafes, my Lord, your immaterial prin¬ 
ciple plays fa ft and loofe in a very extraordi¬ 
nary and capricious manner, and indeed iliews 
fuch a difpofition that I would recommend it 
to your Lordihip not to place much dependance 
on her. 

I have 

r 42 3 

I have now, I fear, tired the reader, and I 
am fare I have tired myfelf in purfuing your 
Lordfhip through the dark and perplexed path 
you have chofen to tread. Nothing but a fpi- 
rit of enterprize far greater than your prudence 
could have impelled you to enter it : for amid 
the various fubjeds of human enquiry, this of 
the difference between true and appa- 
c‘ rent death" appears, even at firft fight, to 
be peculiarly and invincibly hoflile to your 
main purpofe of eftablifhing the notion of 
two or more diftind principles, as fubfervi- 
ent to the life of man. 

I am at a lofs, my Lord, to account for 
your temerity. Was your ambition inflamed 
by the “ lucky dfcoveries of an adverfary, 
over whom in another field, though fuffering 
all the difgrace of defeat, you had difplayed 
all the infblence of triumph ? That advert ary, 
your Lordfhip knows, is thought to have made 

* Which the fame of certain lucky difcoveries, in the profe -

lion and life. He has proceeded fiowly and
