PREFACE 

The tables here presented represent an adaptation of Hotiel’s factor- 
izing method of computing logarithms. We became acquainted with 
Hotel’s basic idea about 30 years ago, when we saw it explained and ex- 
emplified in Dr. E. R. Hedrick’s “Logarithmic and Trigonometric Tables.” 
Fifteen years later we were using our own 20-place Hoel table of natural 
logarithms to compute the so-called ‘“q’s’’ used in preparing our “Smith- 
sonian Elliptic Functions Tables’ (published in 1947). At that time we 
conceived the idea embodied in the present tables and were so convinced 
of its possibilities that we carried out much of the early work in this 
secondary project simultaneously with the computation of the elliptic 
tables. 

Originally we planned a table of natural logarithms only (i.e., to base e), 
but several years later it was decided to include common logarithms 
(i.e., to base 10). This doubled our work and necessitated some revi- 
sion of computations already finished. We feel that the completed design 
justifies the extra work and added expense. 

While the tables were in preparation Miami University assigned four 
students to help in the work and paid them for their efforts—Paul Chifos, 
Eugene Epperson, Steve Pizanis, and Russell Treon. The loyal, pains- 
taking, and efficient work of these young men was a continuing inspiration 
to us, and all out of proportion to the remuneration they received. In fact, 
Mr. Epperson’s work was so extraordinarily helpful that we have placed 
his name with ours on the title page. 

Toward the end of our task we sent photostatic copies of several pages 
of the manuscript to Dr. A. J. Thompson, computer and well-known 
editor of “Logarithmetica Britannica,” for his expert appraisal, not for- 
getting to remind him that he himself had anticipated our idea by several 
years. His friendly and commendatory letter, including many suggested 
improvements, was a valuable aid and probably the deciding factor in the 
difficult task of promoting the publication of the tables. 

We are deeply indebted to the Research Corporation of New York 
for the generous grant of funds to the Smithsonian Institution that made 
possible the publication of this book and also to Dr. Alexander Wetmore, 
Secretary of the Smithsonian, through whose interest and efforts the publi- 
cation of the tables was undertaken by the Institution. Not only was Dr. 
Wetmore chiefly responsible for negotiating the financing of the publica- 
tion, but he and his editorial staff have been most helpful in seeing the 
volume through the press.

INTRODUCTION 

“To those who are continually using interpolation methods, the use of 
factorizing methods with which they are unfamiliar may at first attempt appear 
more lengthy. Such workers will find, however, that this is not so; and that 
after becoming familiar with them, they are at least as short for finding loga- 
rithms, and distinctly shorter for finding antilogarithms.” That is what A. J. 
Thompson had to say in the introduction to part vir of his ‘“Logarithmetica 
Britannica” about the factorizing method for finding logarithms and antiloga- 
rithms. The present volume is devoted exclusively to the factorizing method 
and is composed of two parts, as follows: 

Table 1: 23-decimal-place values of the natural logarithms of XXXX, 
1.0°XXXX, and 1.0°X XXX, the range of XX XX being from 
1 to 10,000. 

Table 2: 23-decimal-place values of the common logarithms of XXXX, 
1.0°XXXX, and 1.0°XX XX, the range of XXXX being from 
1 to 10,000. 

These tables should be a welcome addition to the existing tables of loga- 
rithms. 

The optimu: number of significant figures has been chosen for the range 
of the argument. Five significant figures would increase the number of tabular 
values from the existing 60,000, for both tables, to 600,000. Thus two rela- 
tively large volumes would be required. Further the number of decimal places 
of the logarithm has been extended to 23. This number is the natural point 
of departure permitting the computation ab initio of the logarithm of the 
fourth factor 1.0'°*XXXX ... with ease; for the second term of the series 
In(l+a£)=x—2x°/2+ ... will affect at most the twenty-third decimal place. 
The need for a fourth column is therefore eliminated. 

The computation of the logarithms, to the base e, of the integers was per- 
formed with the aid of Wolfram’s table, which contains the natural logarithms 
of the first 2,200 integers and of primes and certain composite numbers up 
to 10,009 to 48 decimal places. The table actually used was the one given in 
“Thesaurus Logarithmorum Completus” (1794) by George Vega. A complete 
list of known errors in this table was supplied by Prof. Raymond Clare Archi- 
bald, of Brown University, along with an invaluable suggestion. The tabular 
values for the second and third columns were obtained with the aid of the series 
In(1+x) =x—4#?/2+4°/3— ..., and calculated to 28 decimal places. All 
the tabular values for the logarithms, to the base 10, were obtained by multi- 
plying the tabular values in the table of logarithms, to the base e, by the 
modulus 0.43429 . . . , to 28 decimal places. These values were rounded to 
23 decimal places. Both tables were tested by applying differencing tests. 
Throughout the duration of this project hand-operated, calculating machines 
with 10 columns of 10 keys were used for the computing and checking of the 
tables. 

Vii 

In both tables of this volume, the error in the twenty-third place does not 
exceed 0.5. The maximum error, therefore, which can occur in a result 
obtained by adding together three logarithms from the table and the com- 
puted logarithm of the fourth factor will be less than 4(0.5), i.e. less than two 
units in the twenty-third place. 

DIRECT FACTORIZATION 

When the natural logarithm of a number of more than four significant digits 
is desired, the number must be broken up into factors, the first of which con- 
sists of the number formed by the first four digits. The others are the three 
numbers 1.0?XXXX, 1.07X XXX, and 10°%XXXX ... formed from the 
first 8, 12, and 23 digits, respectively, of the quotient that results when the 
division is performed with the preceding factor as divisor and commencing 
with the first four digits. The logarithms of the first three factors are taken 
from the first, second, and third columns, respectively, of table 1. The loga- 
rithm of the last factor, 1OUXXXX ... , is the decimal 0.0UXXXX ..., 
to 23 places, minus a correction factor that may be obtained by a simple 
mental calculation. The sum of these logarithms is the desired logarithm. 

It is assumed, in the example that follows, that the computer has access to 
a calculating machine. 

Example: To find Inz, given the value 
a = 3.14159,26535,89793 ,23846,264 

Solution : 
a = 3.14159,26535,89793,23846,264 
= 3.141 x 1.0918,86830,91306,34780,72588 
= 3.141 x 1.091886 x 1.07830,75638,28242,71930 
= 3.141 x 1.091886 x 1.078307 x 1.0115638,28195,88209 
= 3141 x 1.091886 x 1.078307 x 1.0715638,28195,88209 x 107° 

The above are the factors of a identical, respectively, with 
AXAXK SK LOX KAA KOA XO XX SS. 

In practice it is obviously not necessary to record all the data given above. 
The Jn of the first three factors may be obtained from the three columns of 
table 1. The /n(1.0'15638,28195,88209 ) = 0.0'15638,28195,88209 — 0.077157 = 

0.0"'5638,28195,881, from the series In(1+4%) =x*—-+2°/2+ .. . in which only 
the first two terms are significant. From table 1: 

In 3141 =8.05229,64995,38646,54598,997 

In 1.091886 = 18,85822,17255,84856,087 

In 1.078307 = 830,69996,54968,774 

ino LO" 56385246 = 5638,28195,881 

8.05248,51648,31537,22619,739 
(minus) In 10% =6.90775,52789,82137,05205,397 

Therefore, In + =1.14472,98858,49400,17414,342 
in which there is an error of one unit in the twenty-third decimal place. 

Vili 

Instead of commencing with 3141 as the first factor, 3140 or 3139 could 
have been used. In general, any number may be used as the first factor pro- 
vided the first eight digits of the resulting quotient fall within the interval 
of the argument for the second column of the table. When checking the result 
obtained from one series of values, there is a definite advantage in employing 
an entirely different series. This provides for checking the work of the com- 
puter and the accuracy of these tables. 

In finding the common logarithm of a number, the procedure is much the 
same as that for finding the natural logarithm. Table 2, containing the com- 
mon logarithms, will be used. The characteristic of the common logarithm is 
obtained in the customary manner employed when tables involving interpola- 
tion methods are utilized. The only significant difference is found in the com- 
puted value of the logarithm of the fourth factor. 

To emphasize the modification required when obtaining a common logarithm, 
the following example will illustrate the method in finding the log of 7. The 
four factors are the same, and the logarithms of the first three factors are 
found in the first, second, and third columns, respectively, of table 2. In the 
previous example the /n of the fourth factor was found to be 0.0115638,28195, 
88052. This result must be multiplied by the modulus, 0.43429 ... , and 
their product rounded to 23 decimal places. Hence: 

log 1.0'°5638,28195,88209 = (0.0115638,28195,88209 — 0.0°7157) 
(0.43429,44819,03251,82765,11829) =0.0%2448,67474,212. 

Therefore, the log of z follows: 

log 3.141 =0.49706,79363,98504,77113,023 
log 1.071886 = 8,19002,16339,29522,736 
log LOR30/= 360,76841,11325,155 

log 1.015638... 2448,67474,212 
Thus the log 7 =0.49714,98726,94133,85435,126 

in which there is an error of one unit in the twenty-third decimal place. 

INVERSE FACTORIZATION 

An antilogarithm is found by reversing the process. From the logarithm 
proposed, the natural logarithms of the numbers XXXX, 1.0°XXXX, etc., 
are subtracted in succession. The product of these numbers gives the number 
sought. 

In most cases the value of Jn N should first be brought into that part of 
the table where N lies between 1,000 and 10,000. This may be accomplished 
by adding or subtracting a multiple of /n 10 which only affects the position 
of the decimal point in the value of N. The proper multiple of Jn 10 to be 
added or subtracted may be readily determined if the computer knows only 
the approximate value for the Jn 10=2.3, In 10?=4.6, In 10°=6.9, In 10*=9.2, 
GLC. 

In the example that follows it is again assumed that the computer has 
access to a calculating machine. 

Example: To find x’, given 
In r=1.14472,98858,49400,17414,34273 
Solution : 
In 2? =2.28945,97716,98800,34828,685 
In 10?=6.90775,52789,82137,05205,397 (plus) 

9.19721,50506,80937 ,40034,082 
In? 9.19715,38101,72007,17851,824 = 9869 

6,12405,08930,22182,258 

In? 6,11981,27356,40346,909 = 1.0°0612 
423,81573,81835,349 

i 423,79999,10196,783 = 1.074238 

In 0.00" ,. (0, 01574, 71038 506=1.07415/74 2a, 

the fourth factor of the desired number. Since 0.0111574 . . . is the In of a 
number of the form /n(1+.), we have from the equivalent series: 

x —x?/2=0.0"11574,71638,566 
x =0.0"1574,71638,566 + 12/2 
=0.0'1574,71638,566 + 0.029123 
x=0.0!1574,71638,566 

Hence Jn™*(0.0"1574,71638,566) = 1.0"11574,71638,566. Thus 7?= (9869) 
(1.090612) (1.074238) (1.0°11574,71638,566) (10°) =9.86960,44010,89358,- 
61883,44 in which there is an error of one unit in the last decimal place. 

Instead of commencing by deducting /n 9869 it would be just as con- 
venient to deduct /n 9868 or any logarithm down to /n 9860, and then proceed, 
as before, to the use of table 1. In general any number whose logarithm, 
when subtracted from the given logarithm, results in a remainder that falls 
within the tabular values found in the second column of table 1 may be used. 

In finding an antilogarithm when the common logarithm of a number is 
given, the procedure is much the same as that when the natural logarithm is 
given. When selecting the initial log nearest the value of the given log, it is 
advisable to select the log found between the tabular values for the numbers 
1,000 to 10,000. 

The only significant difference when working with the common logarithms 
of table 2 is found in the computed value of the log of the fourth factor, 
1.0°%XXXX.... The following example will readily explain the procedure 
to follow: 

Example: To find e, given 

log e=0.43429,44819,03251,82765,113 
log 0.43408,96384,17890,77 149,304 = 2.717 

20,48434,85361,05615,809 

log? 20,48084 06847 ,61790,274 = 1.084717 
350,78513,43825,535 
log" 350,77963,88670,210= 1.078077 

log? 0. 0° , O® ,00549,55155,325 may be found by the same 

x 

method applicable to natural logarithms if the above log is first divided by the 
modulus, 0.43429,44819,03251, from the formula In N=(1/p) log N where 
p=0.43429, . . . . This gives a result of 0.0''1265,38921,434517 which is the 
In1.0OUXXXX ... , the fourth factor. Comparison with the procedure used 
in the example for natural logarithms verifies that the value for Jn 1.0°XXXX 
++ = 1,0"1265,38921,435+4-0,0748 = 1.07°1265,38921,435. Therefore e= (2.717) 
(1.084717) (1.078077) (1.0111265,38921,435 ) =2.71828,18284,59045,23536,03. 
This result is correct for 23 significant digits. 

It is interesting to note that the tabular value nearest the given log is the 
log 2718 rather than 2717. Furthermore, the log 2716 could also be used and 
the series derived from use of this tabular value could serve as a check on the 
previous work.
