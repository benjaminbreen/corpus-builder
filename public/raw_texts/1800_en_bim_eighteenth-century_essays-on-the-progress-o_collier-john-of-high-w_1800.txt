The fruit is the perfection of all her proceſs—

productions throughout the vegetable world. What 
wonderful care has ſhe beſtowed on its formation 

and preſervation? You may ſee in the plant a va-

leaves, ſome it flowers, and others its intended

Nature, when ſhe has formed her encloſure, lines 
it with down, or caſes it over with glue, or wraps 
it up in a bag, ſomehow or other ſhe defends it 
even hefore its expanſion bud; but after. this be-

weaving it ſkins, placing it in pith and ſhells, in

As to animal life, the Brute draws in the en

joyment. See him feaſting, or aſleep, firetching 

and growing, in ſearch of pleaſure, where it is al-

_ deceived in his choice? Are not his deſires attain- 

able, and within his reach? adapted to his powers 

of gratification. He neither anticipates nor diver- 
ſiſies his enjoyments. He fixes to himſelf a boun- 
_ dary, and this he never exceeds. He is much oc- 

cupied in the indulgence of his paſſions. and the 

ſupply of his wants; theſe obtained, how perfectly

Hoy, different from the Wild Aſs, whoſetlively

man, from his freedom only, and his ſetting all 
mankind at defiance. Who hath looſed the 
bands of the wild Aſs? whoſe houſe I have made

The Dog. i in FOR 3 exhibits a . Va- 
riety as to ſize, figure, height, and colour. Of all 
animals he is moſt of all attached to Man; fo eaſily | 
taught, bis underſtanding ſeems ſuſceptible of al- 
moſt every impreſſion. The genius of the Dog is 
altogether borrowed from him, he looks up to be 
inſtructed by his maſter, learns. his habits, knows 
his voice, his ſtep, how ſortowful while abſent ! 
how. joyous on his return! All the world over 
would he ſeek his maſter. Proſtrate at your feet, 
be conſults, interrogates, beſeeches, awaits your 
orders, reads them in your eye, every motion and 

ſign is underſtood. Frankly thus, be offers you =

Every action of the Dog intereſts you, his lan- 
' - guage how pathetic ! By a thouſand innocent arts 
he attracts your notice, and ſilently compells: you 
to cheriſh him—he is not to be repulſed—what 
warmth of affection ! See his firſt notice in the 
wagging of his tail, his eye on the watch, his body 
at your feet. What courage in defending you, in 

his fierce attack and fighting for you! Of all the | 
brute creation, a Dog is indeed the moſt ſocial, 
affectionate, and amiable. He preferreth his duty 

to his life—a pattern of fidelity to Man, he ſuf- 

fereth not the approach of the robber. Watchful 

and ſincere; ſportive and affectionate, cheering 

the very heart of his maſter. We are ſurely much 
indebted to our faithful friend the Dog, a compa-

ſhew an arithmetical genius and underſtanding ſu-

efforts, and practice, are all of them neceſſary, to 
bring to perfection even the meaneſt of our arts. 

The Bee's firſt cell, and the Bird's firſt neſt, are 

never yet improved upon. The manufacturer ac- 

quired his firſt principles of ſpinning from the Silk- 
worm, and he is greatly enriched by its labours. 

_ The Weaver learnt his art from the Spider, who 

taught him how to weave. We have alſo another 
leſſon from this intelligent inſect, who, as ſhe fur- 
niſhes materials for her thread out of her own body, 
from prudence and neceſlity ſhe is a good œcono- 

_ miſt. When ſhe weaves her web long, and ſpreads 
it out wide, it will be fine weather, and for many 
days, whereas the barometer informs us only of our 

deſtiny a few hours. When this wiſe propheteſs 

takes to mending her net, and ſtrengthening her 

web, you may expect it to bold fair ſourteen days. f

A good taſte i is, however, little elfe but right 
e which we uſually expreſs by the word judg- 
ment, and yet it differs from it. Judgment forms 
its opinions upon reflexion. Taſte takes no ſuch | 

- pains. On firſt fight of an object ſome impreſſion 

is made, ſome ſentiment acquired. Juſt as the 
ſight is caught in a moment, the ear ſtunned by a 
hatth ſound, and the ſmell delighted with a fra- 
grant odour, before reaſon knows any thing about 
them ; ſo is Taſte, in a like manner, firuok at once, 
and waits for no reflexion.

know little. How two beings ſo widely differing

(though we gain thereby no information) that the 
Soul, while in the body is at home, like as a Man 
in his houſe, and when out of the body; as abroad 
and in the open air. We are, however, ſo formed, 
that certain perceptions in the Soul do invariably 
follow from certain motions in the Body; and, 
ſuch and ſuch motions in the Body always excite

The unenlightened Indian conceives of his Soul

them takes up no more room in our imagination,

innumerable proportions. When we conſider them

point of duration and ſtability. A Plant or a Brute 
arrives, and ſoon, at its perfection ; but, though I 
make ſome progreſs towards it, my advances are 
ſlow, interrupted, and without a poſſibility of ever 
attaining it. That good Being, who, on many 
occaſions, raiſes ſo much delight and ſatisfaction 
in me, could doubtleſs have augmented my felicity, 
and he might have made it perpetual. God has 
power to do this, and he is infinite in goodneſs.

At the transfiguration, Moſes and Elias came 
and converſed with Jeſus - now Moſes died and 
was buried, yet he is here ſpoken of as alive. (On 
his decifion in favour of the Phariſees, and agaitift 
the opinion of the Sadducees) he repreſents God 
* as ſaying—* I am the God of Abraham, of Iſaac, 
and of Jacob.” The Souls of theſe holy men are 
ſtill alive. God is not the God of the dead, but 
. of the living. Sur Souls then, do they ever die 
at all? Can that be ſaid to die which is out of 1 
the reach of mortality? When the great Apoſtle 
ſpeaks of the reſurreclion of the Body, is any men- 
tion made, whatever, of its former companion 5 
ſleeping with it. When, at the trumpet's ſound, = 
the dead in Chriſt ſhall be raiſed, myriads of glo- ®# 
rified bodies ſhall ariſe to life incorruptible im- 9;

thus :—*© Were we indulged in our wiſhes, what

ſatisfy us ? Suppoſe him to aſſume a human form, 
' ſhould we not ſay he was a Man? If God would

to Men, he would chuſe Light for bis Body and 
Truth for his Soul. But—inveſted in an unknown 
and celeſtial form, could we ſee him and live? A 
further diſplay. of his works, inſtead of giving us a 
dlearer view of him, would conſound our feeble 
organs. Fix yourſelf in any point of the Heavens, 
and obſerve the Earth's diurnal motion, the rapid 
whirl of rivers, oceans, kingdoms, with a velocity
