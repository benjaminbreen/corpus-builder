Little Miracle 

By re Sidene Richardson 

Copyright, 1906, by May McKeon 

It‘ was pretty” generally understood 
that the Billy Daltons were drifting 

apart. - There was no particular reason: 

for this state.of affairs, save the lack 
of something better to do... _ 

You see, they had just enough money 
so-that Billy did not have to work nor 
Janet to worry about making both ends 
meet. They had danced: their way 
through several seasons into a lazy, 
good humored and comrade-like engage- 
ment, thence into matrimony. After 

» that Billy had continued to lead co- 
tillons and Janet to dance them, but 
-generally with other partners, 

Matters between them-had reached 
the point where the rumor laden soci- 
ety papers had suggested covertly that 
when Billy went.to England and Scot- 
land, where he had nothing in partic- 
ular to do, Janet would probably.take 
up her home:in Nevada or South Da- 
kota, there to remain until Norman 
Stanley returned from Africa, where 
he ‘was fighting ennul by hunting big 
game, It was even whispered that 
Billy Dalton had “insinuated to Stanley 
that It was rather better taste to stalk 
big game than another man’s wife, es- 
pecially when the’ other man. was per- 
fectly willing to make !t clear sailing 
for his: wife if it would make her any 
happier. 

. Of course, this sounds a-bit strong on 
‘paper, particularly to the old fashioned 
folk who still belleve that marriage is 
‘a contract for life and not a mere epl- 
gode. In the set to which the Billy Dal- 
tons belonged the’ situation was ac- 
‘cepted as a matter of course, and when 
‘Janet asked a lot of people down’ to 

their Long Islqnd: place for. the: auto-. 

‘mobile races and the week end no one 

thought of refusing just because the, 

Daltons might separate within a fort: 
sn ht after the gathering. 
ye Buch was the situation when the 
Dalton car broke.down.on the Jericho 
« turnpike, and its. occupants—Janet, 
ras’ Greenwalt; Joe” Jeffreys ‘and 
:.“Marsh”.. Huntoon—declded to cut 
“through: the woods to:the-Dalton place 
‘and leave the car for'a farmer to guard 
until; the: mechanic. who. handled the 
“Dalton ‘garage could be, dispatched to 
‘the scene of the accident. C 
Perhaps it was -not entirely "impa- 
tiencd which led them to take. the 
short cut through the woods, but the 
call of a. hundred ‘autumn voices, In 
rustling leaves, rich, warm colorings 
and-the chatter of squirrels laying up 
winter, stores...'And thus it was. that 
they suddenly .stopped In their tracks 

4) and‘ listened to’a sound that’ was not 

* of the woods, but of the nursery—the 
~ plaintive wall of a child.. Janet it was 
who found it—a’ bit‘\of white faced, 
staringeyed‘ humanity rolled up- snug- 
ly ina great’ shay] of Iceland wool. ’ 

While'she held the baby.‘In her arms 
and tried to silence Its wails with: un- 
certain and awlgvard little pettings the 
quartet held a conference., The child 
‘was ‘too young to have: walked there. 
Mrs. Greenwalt said _{t was not-a day 

over two, months old. It ‘was too far 
from’ the’ ‘road to be heard ; by. passing 
-travelers. Ah—there was the answer, 
- a wisp of paper tied to the end of the 
shawl: 

“Please take care of. little Elsie. It 

“Was not’ her:fault that she came- into 
the world, and I can do no more.’ 

“T’ve always said: that the govern- 

‘- ment ought to regulate the question of 
marriage among the poor,” remarked 
.Mrs. Greenwalt' severely. . “Here isa 
“ease In, point.” . 

“You./are Jumping ‘at conclusions; HY 
‘sald Huntoon ‘dryly. “Let’s. take it ‘to 
the town marshal’— 

“And what then?” asked Janet with- 
out lifting her gaze from the.child’s 
face. :The’ baby -had..clutched : her fin- 
‘ger with Its ‘tiny fist and settled down 
as if !t had found anchorage, _- 

“Oh, there are asylums “and” homes

earry the little beggar for you?” 

“Oh, no. She's not 9 bit heavy, and 
she Is quiet now. She might cry if we 
changed her position.” : 
~ They trudged. on through rustling 
leaves and soft Indian summer haze, 

three of ‘the party chatting gayly; two,. 

the young wife and the baby; ‘looking 
into each other’s. eyes 2s if searching 
‘for.a new key to the problem of. life. 
Sometimes. Janet. wished-that the child 
-.. would close its eyes, -She did not like 

‘@. to:meet that trustful, clear’. eyed gaze.

the crucial moment? 

Within the Dulton bungalow on Long 
Island: stranger. things were- happen- 
ing.'.No clew to the baby's. parents 
had been found. When .Billy. Dalton 
dropped down occasionally, as he had 
been doing for a year past to keep.up 
appearances, his. first. question | was, 
“Anything new?” and — this: always 
meant. “anything new about the baby’s 
history.”..And. litfle Elsie. would: look 
up at him' with reproachful blue eyes 
as if asking; “Why do you care?”’. And 

the worst of it was that Billy Dalton. 

began to realize that he did care. . Janet. 
had. changed, ‘and, with an. odd -sort 
of jealousy, he realized that it was lit- 
tle Hisle' and not he who had brought 
about the marvelous and altogether de- 
sirable, change. . She. was no. longer 
bored. - How could she be with Elsie 
cutting a new ‘tooth. every few days 
and such wonderful hampers of clothes 
to-be bought, -fine handkerchief: linen, 
nayrow val and convent embroidery? 
A more fastidious customer had never 
‘entered the shops which specialize on 
layettes, and with her own hands Janet 
made covers for down~ pillows, silk 
tufted afghans and other foolish things, 
while the tongue of gossip. wagged 
gayly over the whole absurd episode. 

One frosty December afternoon Dal- 
ton ran down to the bungalow and 
found Janet standing. at.the window. 
The low spreading evergreens on the 
“west side of the house were powdered 
lightly with snow, and Janet turned to 
him with kindling eyes. 3 

“Billy, I shall have a Christmas uae 
for Hisie. She Js so bright for her age, 
I do believe she will notice It.” F 

“Quite likely,” responded Billy, with 
assumed carelessness, as she laid aside 
his storm coat, “but in makifig your 
plans you seem to have overlooked one 
important fact... As yet BHisie {snot 
really yours. .The law”— 

Janet turned.on him sharply. 

“She is mine by right of—everything. 
I found her, and I love her.” 

“Yes, -but you must formally adopt 
her.. I thought perhaps you'd. better 
see to that before I leave. I’ve changed 
my plans ‘a bit. I’m going’ to meet 
mother and-Grace in Rome: for Christ- 
mas...The mater has not been feeling 
very fit. I.am not fond of England in 
winter, and”—"" 

Janet crossed.‘ to: hig ‘side, and her 
hand rested lightly on his arm. 

“Don’t: you think. you'd enjoy much 
more: seeing Elsie have her first tree? 
And—and ; I: think—I* need Jou_more 
than your'mother does.”.: 

Something’ rose’ in. Dalton’s throat 
and threatened to choke him. It was ‘a 
sensation he had. never felt before, not 
even during the good natured, lazy run 
of his wooing... Janet wanted him!): He 
thought he had not cared/Now. he 
knew that he had cared all along. But 
dt was ‘characteristic he did not express 
‘his fierce joy in words. . He held Janet 
very close and whispered: 

“Well, I rather. did hope’ you'd give 

the little beggar the name’ of Dalton.: 

It’s a- pretty good name after:all, eh?’

CHAPTER XII. 

R. CAREWE returned one 

warm May afternoon by the 

6 o'clock boat, which was 
sometimes a day late and 
sometimes a few hours early, the lat- 
ter contingency arising, as in the pres- 
ent Instance, when the owner was 
aboard. Nelson drove him from the 
wharf to the bank, where he conferred 

briefy in an undertone with Eugene 
Madrillon, after which Eugene sent a - 

note containing three words to Tap- 
pingham Marsh. Marsh tore up the 
note and sauntered over to the club, 
where he found General Trumble and 
Jefferson Bareaud. 

“He has come,” said Tappingham, 
pleased to find the pair the only occu- 
pants of the place. “He saw Madril- 
lon, and there's a session tonight.” 

“Praise the Lord!” exclaimed the ! 
stout gencral, rising to his feet. “I'll : 
see old Chenoweth at once. My Singers 
have the itch.” ‘ 

“And mine, too,” said Bareaud, “I'd 
begun to think we'd never have a go 
with him again.” ’ . 

“You. must see that Crailey- comes. 
We want a full table. Drag him if you 
can't get him any other way.’’ 

“He won't need urging,” said Jeffer- 
son. 

“But he cut us last time.” 

“He won’t cut tonight. What hour?” 

“Nino,” answered Tappingham. “It’s 
to be a full sitting, remember.” 

“Don’t fear for us,” laughed Trum- 
ble. 

“Now for Crailey,’’ Jefferson added. 
“After. so long a vacation you couldn't 
keep him away if you chained him to 
. the courthouse pillars, He’d tear ‘em 

in two!” , 

But Jefferson did not encounter the 
alacrity of acceptance he expected from 
Cralley when he found him half an 
hour later at the hotel. - Indeed, at first 
Mr. Gray not only refused outright, but 
seriously urged the same course. upon 
Jefferson. Moreover, his remonstrance 
was offered In such good faith that 
Bareaud, in the act of swallowing .one 
of his large doses of quinine, paused 

“with only half the powder down his 
throat, gazing, ‘nonplused, at his pro- 
apective brother-in-law. . 

“My immortal soul!” he gasped. “Is 
this Crailey Gray? What's the trou- 
ble?” . ° 

“Nothing,” replied Gray quietly. 

“Only don’t go; you've lost enough.” 

~ “Well, you're a beautiful one!” Jef- 

ferson exclaimed, with:an incredulous 

laugh. “You're a master hand... .You 
to talk about losing enough!” - 

. “I ‘know, I know,” Crailey began, 
shaking his head, “but’— 

“You've promised Fanchon never to 
go again, and you're afraid Miss Betty 

‘will see or hear us and tell her you 
: were there.” ; i ee 

“I don’t know Miss Carewe.” 

“Then. you needn't fear. Besides, 
she'll be out when we come and asleap 
when we go... She. will never know 
we've been.in the house.” 

_ “That has nothing to do witb it,” 

said’ Crailey !mpatiently, and he was. 

the more earnest because he remember- 
., @4@ the dangerous geography of the Ca- 

-rewe house, which made it impossible 
‘for any one to leave the cupola room 
except by the long hall which passed 
certain doors. “I will not go, and, 
_. what’s more, ‘I: promised Fanthon I'd 

_ try to keep you out of it hereafter.” 

“Lord, but we're virtuous!” laughed 
the incredulous Jefferson. “I’ll come 
for you at a quarter to 9.” 

“I will not go, I tell you.” 

Jefferson roared. “Yes, you will. 
You couldn’t keep from it if you tried!” 
. And he took himself off, laughing vio- 

lently, again promising to call for Cral- 
ley on his way to the tryst and leaving 
him still warmly protesting that it 
would be a great folly for either of 
them to go. : 

Crailey looked after the lIad’s long, 
thin figure with an expression as near 
anger os he ever wore. ‘He'll go,” ho 

. said to himself. 
“And—ah, well—I’ll have to risk it! 
T’ll go with him;. but only to ‘try to 
. bring him away early—that is, ad early 
as it’s safe to be sure that they are 
:asleep downstairs. -And I won't play. 

No, I'll not play; I'll not play.” 

He went out of the hotel by a aide 
door. Some distance up the street 
Bareaud was still to be seen, lounging 
homeward in the pleasant afternoon 
sunshine. He stopped on a corner and 
serenely. poured. another quinine pow- 
‘der into himself and threw the paper to 
a couple of’ pigs that looked up from 
the gutter maliciously. 

“Confound him!” sald‘ Crailey, laugh- 
ing ruefully. “He makes me a mis- 
sionary—for I’ll keep my word to F'an- 
chon in that, at least! I’ll look after ; 
Jefferson tonight. Ah, I might as well 
be old Tom Vanrevel, indeed!” 

Meanwhile Mr. Carewe. had taken 

. possession of his own again.. His 

‘daughter ran to the door ty meet him. 
She was trembling a little and, blush- 
{ng and. smiling, held out -both her 
hands to him, so that Mrs, Tanberry 
., vowed this was the loveliest creature in 

the world, and the kindest. ‘ 

Mr.. Carewe bowed alightly, as to an 
acquaintance, and disregarded the ex- 
tended hands. 

At that the blush faded from Miss 
Betty’s cheeks, she trembled no more, 
anda salutation as icy as her father’s 
Wag returned tohim. He bent his heavy 
brows upon her and shot a black glance 
her way, being, of course, immediately 
enraged by her reflection -of his own 
manner, but he did not speak to her. 

‘Nor did ‘he once address her during 
the evening meal, preferring to honor 
Mrs. Tanberry with his conversation, 
to that diplomatic Indy’s secret anger, 

. but outward amusement. She cheerfal- 
“ly neglected to answer him at times, 
having not the slightest awe of him, 
and turned to the girl {nstead; indeed, 
ahe was only prevented from -rating 
‘him soundly at his own table by the 
fear that she might make the situation 
More difficult foxber yourg charge. As 

@60n as It was pdsiibie se Mhade her 
escape with Miss Betty, and they drove 
away in the twilight to pay visits of 
duty, leaving Mr. Carewe frowning at 
his coffee on the veranda, —~ 

When they came home three hours ! jow, And here he was, 

later Miss Betty noticed’ that a fringe 
of illumination bordered each of the 
heavily curtained windows in the cu- 
pola, and she uttered an exclamation, 
for she had never known that room to 
We lighted. ; 

“Look!” she cried, touching Mra, 
Tanberry’s arm, as the horses trotted 
through the gates under a drizzle of 
rain. “I thought the room in the cupola 
was empty. It’s always locked, and 
when I came from St. Mary’s he told 
me that old furniture was stored 
there.” ; 

Mrs. Tanberry was grateful for the 
darkness. “He may have gone there to 
read,” she answered in a queer voice. 
“Let us-go quietly to bed, child, so as 
not to disturb him.” 

Betty had as little desire-to disturb 
her father as she had to see him; there- 
fore she obeyed her friend’s injunction 
and went to her room on tiptoe. The 
house was very silent as she lit the 
candles on her bureau. Outside the 
gentle drizzle and the soothing tinkle 
from the eaves were the only. sounds. 
Within there was but the faint rustle 
of garments from Mrs. Tanberry’s 
room. Presently the latter ceased to be 
heard, and a wooden moan of protest 
from. the four. poster upon which the 
good lady reposed announced that she © 
had drawn the curtains and wooed the 
rulers of Nod.  
“’ Although it was one of those nights 
of which they say, “It is a good night 
to sleep,” Miss Betty. was not drowsy. 
She had half unfastened one small san- 
dal, but she tied the ribbons again and - 
seated herself by. the open . window. . 
Peering out into the dismal-night, she 
found her own: future. as black, and it 
seemed no wonder that the. sisters 
loved the convent life; that the. pale: 
nuns forsook the world wherein there 
was 50 much useless unkindness, where - 
women were petty. and jeslous, ’ like 
that cowardly Fanchon, and:men who 
looked great were tricksters, like Fan- 
chon’s betrothed. Miss Betty. clinched 
her delicate fingers. She would not re- 
member that white, startled: face 
again. ' : Sd 

Another face helped her to shut out 
the recollection—that of the man who 
had come to mass to meet her yester- 
day morning and. with whom she had. 
taken'a long walk afterward. He had 
shown her a quaint old English garden- 
er who lived on the bank of the river, 
had bought her a bouquet, and she had: 
helped him to select another to send to 
a sick friend. How beautiful the flow-, 
ers were. and how happy he had made 
the morning for‘her with ‘hig, gayety, 
his lightness and Ws odd wisdom! Was 
it. only yesterday? Her father’s com- 
ing had made yesterday a fortnight 
old. 

But the ‘continuously pattering rain 
and the soft drip, drop from the roof, 
though as mournful as sho chose to 
find them, began after awhile to- weave 
their somnolent spells, and she slowly 

| Grifted from.reveries of unhappy sorts 

into half. dreams, in which she was 
still aware she was awake, yet:sium- 
ber, heavy eyed, stirring from the cur- 
tains beside her with the small night 
breeze, breathed strange distortions 
upon familiar things, and drowsy im- 
possibilities moved upon the surface of 
ber thoughts. Her chin, resting upon 
her hand, sank gently until her head 
almost lay upon-her relaxed arms. 

“That is’mine, Crailey Gray!" 

She sprang to her feet, immeasurably 
startled, one hand clutching the back 
of her chair, the other tremulously 
pressed. to her cheek, convinced that. 
her father had stooped over her and 
shouted the sentence in her ear. For 
it was his voice, and the house rang 
with the words. All the rooms, halls, 
and -even the walls, still seemed mur- 
murous with the sudden sound, like the 
tinkling of a bell after it has been 
struck. And yet—everything was quict. 

Sbe pressed her fingers to her fore- 
head; trying to untangle the maze of 
dreams which had evolved this shock 
for her, the sudden clamor in her fa- 
ther’s voice of a name she hated and 
hoped never to hear again, a name she 
was trying to forget, but as she was 
unable to trace anything which had 
led to it there remained only the con- 
clusion that her.nerves were not what 
they should be, The vapors having he- 
come obsolete for young: ladies as an 
explanation for all unpleasant sensa- 
tions, they were instructed to have 
“nerves.” This was Miss Betty’s first 
consciousness of ber own, and, desir- 
ing no greater acquaintance with them, 
she told herself {t was unwholesome to 
fall asleep in a chair by an open win- 
dow when the night was as sad as she. 

Turning to a chair in front of the 
smajl oval mirror of her bureau, she 
unclasped the brooch which held her 
lace collar and, seating herself, began 
to unfasten her hair. Suddenly she 
paused, her uplifted arms falling me- 
chanically to her sides. 

Some one was coming through the 
long hall with a soft, almost Inaudible 
step, a step which was not her father’s, 
She knew at once, with instinctive cer- 
tainty, that it was not he. Nor was it 
Nelson, who would have shuffled; nor 
could it be the vain Mamie, nor one of 
the other servants, for they did not 
sleep in the house, It was a step more 
like a woman’s, though certainly it was 
not Mrs. Tanberry’s, . 

Betty rose, took a candle and stood 
silent for a moment, the heavy tresses 
of her hair, half unloosed, falling upon 
her neck and left shoulder like the 
folds of a dark drapery. 

At the slight rustle of her rising the 
steps ceased instantly. Her heart set 
up a wild beating, and the candle 
shook in her hand. But she was brave. 
and young, and, following an irresisti- 
ble impulse, she ran across the. room, 
flung open the door and threw the ight 
of tha candle int th 

aasater: 

ball, holding it !

A STATESMAN JUDGE. 

Or, Loudon Tells Some Unpublished 
History of Northwest Rebellion. 

A finely appreciative and illuminat- 
Ing review of the life and work of the 
late Mr. Justice Street: is contributed 
to the current issue of The University 
of Toronto Monthly by ex-President 
Loudon, a life-long friend and ‘asso- 
ciate of the deceased jurist. The ar- 
ticle contains -some very interesting 
references to incidents -in his life 
which have not hitherto. been: given 
ublicity, especially in relation to the 
mportant public services-he perform- 
21 as chairman of the Northwest Half- 
breeds’ Claims Commission’ appointed 
in 1886.. : . . 

The mission of the commission was 
to make lists of persons entitled ‘to 
land grants-in compensation for their 
dispossession at law by the Dominion 
when’ it- assumed. ownership in. -1870. 
The Government -at the: time. of the 
Appointment “of the. commission. was 
not prepared with any. definite: policy 
regarding the plan of allotment, and 
Mr. Street’ was told ‘thatthe commis- 
sioners, must do: the-best they could, 
and if ‘he half-breeds' did not “come 
in. to enter. their’ claims no:blame 
cculd attach to him or his associates 
for their failure... Just at thia ‘june- 
ture, on March 27, 1885, news: arrived 
at Ottawa thatthe) smouldering: dis- 
content among. the “half-breeds. of. the 
Northwest had ‘burst-into: flame, and 
a conflict: had’ taken’ place ‘at Duck 
Lake. That same evening Mr. Street 
applied:-to Sir, John “Macdonald. for 
increased: powers: for the commission. 
He asked that’ they: be given’ author- 
ity nots only -to:' make. lists, : but. to 
sive each’~half-breed: | as-:he . applied 
fo: land his scrip.-' Sir: John’ prompt- 
ly. concurred, ‘and. the commission left 
Ottawa for Winnipeg. on: April 7 cloth- 
24. with: this’ added authority. After 
the first'interview with half-breeds at 
Port Qu’Appelle, on the request of the 
ecmmissioners they ‘were also: given 
power to allot land-as well'es to give 
scrip: for 80 much money: with which 
land’ could be purchased at a -dollar 
per acre, :: : 5 z 
,_ At the next: session ‘of the commig- 
sion after much difficulty one: of the 
half-breed womren was persuaded “to 
accept scrip for her land claim.: This 
scrip was immediately turned into 
monoy by. sale to the agent of a Win- 
Nipeg banker. The: suspicions and 
wlarm:of the Indians were quieted b 
this tangible evidence of the .g 
faith of the commission, -and the news 
quickly spread among the assembled 
half-breeds.’ The work thus auspici- 
ously begun by the. commission: was. 
conducted successfully to ‘its “close, 
and hundreds of half-breeds and their’ 
Indian: friends were prevented ‘from: 
joining the rebel forces: under: Riel, 

So ‘successful, says. Dr. Loudon,. was; 
the whole mission that it:.deserved' 
the name of the. Peace Commission, ' 
and its achievements’ are entitled to! 
jake. rank with those of. the’ milita 
forces under: General Middleton. th! 
should not be forgotten, however, that! 
the commission‘ would have’ proved: a 
lamentable: failure had it not been, 
clothed with the powers which Mr 
Street’s foresight secured when he was 

west. 

Dr. Loudon also narrates a few in- 
cidents from the story of the com- 
mission’s work illustrative of. the di-: 
plomacy and good judgment of Mr. | 
Btreet in dealing with the half-breeds 
at a time when lack of caution, firm- 
ness.or knowledge of the Indian char-' 

acter would have had very serious. 

results in fomenting further trouble 
in the sparsely settled west.. For in-' 
stance, at one of the first sessions he 
first act was to make a kite for tho 
yonnesere, the first kite flown in the 
orthwest—and this kindly act was 
followed by his sending to Winnipeg 
for a couple of footballs, with which’ 
e taught the boys-.the mysteries of 
the Association game. Nothing could 
have been more effective in gaining 
the good-will of the excited and re- 
tentful Indians, i

Such was the ‘condition of Miss Marie

liams’ Pink: Pills.:She‘says: © ‘‘For 
ja mumber ‘of years: I. have been. a 
servant. Up to a year-ago*I alwdys 
enjoyed the best of-health, but sud- 
side,” I was seized with pains in my 

side, my appetite left-me, I- became}- 

dyspeptic and -lost ‘all ‘strength. 

| consulted .a doctor who.told.me I was 
_ suffering from general debility. I was 
forced to stop work and. for three 
‘months I followed :the ‘doctor’s treat-- 
;ment, but without benefit. I was ad: 
vised to try Dr, Williams’: Pink Pills, 
and.aa- I -had .often-read of the: cases 
‘they cured; I decided to do so. 
‘only took eight’ boxes before I was 
‘cured and*today.I-am stronger than 
;I ever was. My digestion is good and 
:IT can now go about: my work with- 
out fatigue. I owe a debt of grati- 
tude to Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for 
what they have done’ for’'me and I 
strongly advise other weak sickly 

 girls to give them «a. trial.” 

Miss Fleury’s case is one of many 
'thet Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have 
cured after doctors’-help had failed. 
The success of these -pills lies in the 
fact that: they strike right at the 
root of the trouble—the blood. Other 
medicines simply act-on the symp- 
/toms of the trouble—and ‘may relieve; 
but they do not’cure. Dr. ‘Williams’ 
Pink Pills make new rich: blood — 
that is why they cure dyspepsia, 
rheumatism, anaemia, heart. palpita- 
| tion, headache, backache and. the ills 
of women; all these are caused by 
bad blood—Dr, Williams’ Pink Pills 
cure them all because they make new 
blood. For sale at druggists or by
